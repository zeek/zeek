  * Return fully-escaped string if utf8 conversion fails (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    This adds a new function for validating UTF-8 sequences by converting to
    UTF-32. This allows us to also check for various blocks of codepointsi
    that we consider invalid while checking for valid sequences in general.

4.2.0-dev.76 | 2021-08-18 08:40:41 -0700

  * Fix option length computation in Geneve analyzer. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

    We previously computed the length of the Geneve options field
    incorrectly which lead to us passing data at an incorrect offset to
    inner analyzers. With this patch we now interpret the length field
    correctly, according the the spec
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8926#section-3.4.

    Closes #1726.

  * Do not lookup ignore_checksums_nets for every packet (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This could lead to a noticeable (single-percent) performance
    improvement.

    Most of the functionality for this is in the packet analyzers that now
    cache ignore_chesksums_nets.

    Based on a patch by Arne Welzel (Corelight).

4.2.0-dev.68 | 2021-08-04 09:57:32 +0100

  * Under certain circumstances, Zeek processes could get into an infinite looping state inside RotationTimer.
    This is fixed by handling special cases of rotation happening exactly on the time boundary, and fixing

  * GH-1684: Ensure that the time gets updated every pass if we're reading live traffic (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    This is necessary for e.g. packet sources that don't have a selectable
    file descriptor. They'll always be ready on a very short timeout, but
    won't necessarily have a packet to process. In these case, sometimes
    the time won't get updated for a long time and timers don't function
    correctly.

4.2.0-dev.43 | 2021-07-21 11:41:19 -0700

  * Fix handling of timers when cloning TableVals (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    When cloning TableVals, a new timer was created for the wrong object
    (the existing TableVal, not the clone). This lead to the already
    existing timer being no longer accessible. Which, in turn, leads to an
    abandoned timer reading into no longer allocated data when the original
    TableVal is deleted.

    Fixes GH-1687

  * Use Cirrus's new greedy mode for parallelizing builds and tests (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This oversubscribes our cores 2x, which testing shows we actually
    run with at times: speedup is around a third on average for builds,
    and a bit more than that for testing.

    Also some light Bashification in ci/build.sh, for consistency.

4.2.0-dev.30 | 2021-07-19 08:54:30 -0700

  * Fix registration of protocol analyzers from inside plugins. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    With the recent packet manager work, it broke to register a protocol
    analyzer for a specific port from inside a plugin's initialization code.
    That's because that registration now depends on the packet manager being
    set up, which isn't case at that time a plugin's `InitPostInit()` runs.
    This fix contains two parts:

        - Initialize the packet manager before the analyzer manager, so that
          the latter's `InitPostScript()` can rely on the former being
          ready.

        - Change the analyzer manager to (only) record port registrations
          happening before it's fully initialized. Its `InitPostScript()`
          then performs the actual registrations, knowing it can use the
          packet manager now.

    This comes with a `cmake/` to add a missing include directory.

  * Fix race conditions in scripts.base.frameworks.input.reread (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    On FreeBSD, this test showed two problems: (1) reordering problems
    based on writing the predicate, event, and end-of-data updates into a
    single file, (2) a race condition based on printing the entirety of
    the table description argument in update events. The description
    contains the destination table, and its content at the time an update
    event gets processed isn't deterministic: depending on the number
    of updates the reader thread has sent, the table will contain a
    varying number of entries.

  * Fix race condition in scripts.base.frameworks.input.invalid* (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    The invalidset and invalidtext tests loaded an input file via table
    and event reads, in parallel. On FreeBSD this triggers an occasional
    reordering of messages coming out of the reader thread vs the input
    managers. This commit makes the table and event reads sequential,
    avoiding the race.

4.1.0-dev.916 | 2021-07-08 16:49:55 -0700

  * Add a cluster controller testcase for agent-controller checkin (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This verifies that in a setup with the supervisor creating both controller and
    agent, the agent successfully checks in with the controller.

  * Add zeek-client via new submodule (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    The new module resides in auxil/zeek-client. It does not get installed unless
    one configures with --enable-zeek-client.

  * Introduce cluster controller and cluster agent scripting (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This is a preliminary implementation of a subset of the functionality set out in
    our cluster controller architecture. The controller is the central management
    node, existing once in any Zeek cluster. The agent is a node that runs once per
    instance, where an instance will commonly be a physical machine. The agent in
    turn manages the "data cluster", i.e. the traditional notion of a Zeek cluster
    with manager, worker nodes, etc.

    Agent and controller live in the policy folder, and are activated when loading
    policy/frameworks/cluster/agent and policy/frameworks/cluster/controller,
    respectively. Both run in nodes forked by the supervisor. When Zeek doesn't use
    the supervisor, they do nothing. Otherwise, boot.zeek instructs the supervisor
    to create the respective node, running main.zeek.

    Both controller and agent have their own config.zeek with relevant knobs. For
    both, controller/types.zeek provides common data types, and controller/log.zeek
    provides basic logging (without logger communication -- no such node might
    exist).

    A primitive request-tracking abstraction can be found in controller/request.zeek
    to track outstanding request events and their subsequent responses.

  * Establish a separate init script when using the supervisor (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    The supervisor does not require the full weight of scripts that
    init-default.zeek brings with it. The new file, init-supervisor.zeek, contains
    only what's required by the supervisor in addition to the other always-loaded
    init files.

  * Add optional bare-mode boolean flag to Supervisor's node configuration (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    When omitted, the node inherits the Supervisor's bare-mode
    status. When true/false, the new Zeek node will enable/disable bare
    mode, respectively. It continues to load any scripts passed at the
    command line and in the additional scripts list already provided in
    the node configuration.

    Includes testcase.

  * Add support for making the supervisor listen for requests (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    The supervisor now starts listening on the configured Broker default address and
    port when the new boolean SupervisorControl::enable_listen is T. Listening
    remains disabled by default. Listening allows nodes to communicate with the
    supervisor via the events laid out in control.zeek, to conduct further node
    management.

  * Add support for setting environment variables via supervisor (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    The NodeConfig record now has a table for specifying environment variable names
    and values, which the supervisor sets in the created node.

    This also repositions the cpu_affinity member to keep the order the same in
    the corresponding script-layer and in-core types.

    Includes testcase.

  * Fix the builtin plugin preload mechanism (Seth Hall, Corelight)

  * Update submodule pointer for cmake to point at the appropriate branch (Seth Hall, Corelight)

  * Switch to more accurate source and binary references in cmake (Seth Hall, Corelight)

    This is mostly involved with moving CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and
    CMAKE_BINARY_DIR to PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR and PROJECT_BINARY_DIR because it
    enables zeek to be built as a subproject of another.

    There is another branch in the cmake repository with the same name that
    is also required for this to fully work.

4.1.0-dev.884 | 2021-07-05 10:06:59 +0100

  * Add ability to check if hostname is valid for a specific cert (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This commit adds two new bifs, x509_check_hostname and
    x509_check_cert_hostname. These bifs can be used to check if a given
    hostname which can, e.g., be sent in a SNI is valid for a specific
    certificate.

    This PR furthermore modifies the ssl logs again, and adds information
    about this to the log-file. Furthermore we now by default remove the
    server certificate information from ssl.log - I doubt that this is often
    looked at, it is not present in TLS 1.3, we do still have the SNI, and
    if you need it you have the information in x509.log.

    This also fixes a small potential problem in X509.cc assuming there
    might be SAN-entries that contain null-bytes.

  * Add ssl_history field to ssl.log (Johanna Amann)

    This is the equivalent to a connection history for SSL - and contains
    information about which protocol messages were exchanged in which order.

  * Add policy script suppressing certificate events (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    The added disable-certificate-events-known-certs.zeek disables repeated
    X509 events in SSL connections, given that the connection terminates at
    the same server and used the samt SNI as a previously seen connection
    with the same certificate.

    For people that see significant amounts of TLS 1.2 traffic, this could
    reduce the amount of raised events significantly - especially when a
    lot of connections are repeat connections to the same servers.

    The practical impact of not raising these events is actually very little
    - unless a script directly interacts with the x509 events, everything
    works as before - the x509 variables in the connection records are still
    being set (from the cache).

  * Add new ssl-log-ext policy script (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This policy script significantly extends the details that are logged
    about SSL/TLS handshakes.

  * Deprecate extract-certs-pem.zeek and add log-certs-base64.zeek (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    Extract-certs-pem writes pem files to a dedicated file; since it does
    not really work in cluster-environments it was never super helpful.

    This commit deprecates this file and, instead, adds
    log-certs-base64.zeek, which adds the base64-encoded certificate (which
    is basically equivalent with a PEM) to the log-file. Since, nowadays,
    the log-files are deduplicates this should not add a huge overhead.

  * Implement X509 certificate log caching (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    By default, each certificate is now output only once per hour. This also
    should work in cluster mode, where we use the net broker-table-syncing
    feature to distribute the information about already seen certificates
    across the entire cluster.

    Log caching is also pretty configureable and can be changed using a
    range of confiuration options and hooks.

    Note that this is currently completely separate from X509 events
    caching, which prevents duplicate parsing of X509 certificates.

  * Deprecate ICSI SSL notary script. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    The ICSI notary is pretty much inactive. Furthermore - this approach
    does no longer make much sense at this point of time - performing, e.g.,
    signed certificate timestamp validation is much more worthwhile.

  * Change SSL and X.509 logging format (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This commit changes the SSL and X.509 logging formats. Logs are
    now indexed by their hash and no longer by the file ID.

    This commit introduces two new options, which determine if certificate
    issuers and subjects are still logged in ssl.log. The default is to have
    the host subject/issuer logged, but to remove client-certificate
    information. Client-certificates are not a typically used feature
    nowadays.

  * Enable OCSP logging by default. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    It turns out that this can actually contain a slew of interesting
    information - like operating systems querying for the revocation of
    software signing certificates, e.g.

  * Split the code that handles X509 event hashing into its own file (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This also improves documentation of this feature.

4.1.0-dev.864 | 2021-07-02 12:50:40 -0700

  * Add a global log policy hook to the logging framework (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This addresses the need for a central hook on any log write, which
    wasn't previously doable without a lot of effort. The log manager
    invokes the new Log::log_stream_policy hook prior to any filter-specific
    hooks. Like filter-level hooks, it may veto a log write. Even when
    it does, filter-level hooks still get invoked, but cannot "un-veto".

    Includes test cases.

    Additional CT logs can be added in user-scripts.

    The framework so far populated data structures with missing fields

    populated.

    Update tests to reflect focus on unset fields.

4.1.0-dev.764 | 2021-06-27 10:50:19 -0700

  * Remove unnecessary -B arguments from Zeek invocations in testsuite

    Now that Zeek no longer silently accepts -B when not compiled in debug
    mode, these tests were failing. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Fix perftools-enabled build (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Minor tweaks to single-character command line option handling

    - Use of "-B" now triggers usage output and errors out when Zeek
      wasn't built with debugging support.

    - Always keep the perftools options (-m, -M) in the optparse string,
      for consistency with other flags dependent on configuration. We
      still fall through to usage and erroring out as before.

    - Minor indentation fix. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.760 | 2021-06-27 10:46:01 -0700

    Add required HasField check before GetFieldAs call (Luke Cesarz)

4.1.0-dev.755 | 2021-06-23 13:53:54 -0700

  * Call brew update-reset in ci/macos/prepare.sh

    This fixes some issues with the Catalina builds when it prepares the image
    and the base Cirrus image has old recipes for Homebrew. The VM then has
    to build a bunch of packages it shouldn't need to. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * GH-1368: Use --osx-sysroot for macOS CI builds (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.750 | 2021-06-21 16:14:03 -0700

  * Remove the Stepping Stone analyzer

    This commit removes the stepping stone analyzer. It has been deactivated
    by default since at least Zeek 2.0, is dysfunctional in cluster settings
    and has a bunch of other issued.

    Relates to GH-1573 (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.748 | 2021-06-21 15:41:29 -0700

  * Drop Fedora 32 from CI, now past EOL (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Remove a double-defined TLS cert from a Broker btest (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.744 | 2021-06-21 09:17:36 +0200

  * Add a new field `email_dest` to NOTICEs, which defines where to
    send email to. The email-related NOTICE actions fill this now, and
    then emails will be sent to all recorded addresses at the end of
    NOTICE processing. This makes email generation more consistent and
    extensible. (Vlad Grigorescu)

  * Add page and email administrator to mails processed by hostnames
    extension. (Vlad Grigorescu)

4.1.0-dev.731 | 2021-06-17 10:40:58 +0100

  * Change SSH version field to be `&optional`.

    In version 3.3.0-dev.537 we added handling for SSH version 1.99 which
    used a SSH version of 0 to indicate weird cases where no version could be
    determined.

    This patch is a fixup for that patch. We now use an `&optional` version value.
    If no SSH version can be eixtracted the version will be unset; additionally a
    `conn_weird` event will be raised. See GH-1590. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.727 | 2021-06-14 16:19:34 -0700

    the logging directory. (Henrik Kramselund Jereminsen)

4.1.0-dev.715 | 2021-06-09 09:12:26 -0700

  * Fix macOS Big Sur builds on Cirrus

    - Upgrade the Big Sur VM to use the Xcode 12.5 version. This has a newer
      version of brew installed on it that fixes an issue with an EOL package host
      that finally shut down for good recently.
    - Use 'brew upgrade' for openssl and cmake, since those are both present on the
      base VM. This prevents 'brew install' from printing an error if the package
      exists but is out of date. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.713 | 2021-06-08 13:54:28 -0700

  * Split session adapter code into separate files from the analyzers (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Move adapter-specific code back into the adapter (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Move ICMP counterpart methods outside of ICMPAnalyzer class

    These were previously global methods in the old analyzer, and moving them
    to be private members of ICMPAnalyzer broke the usage of them by at least
    one external plugin. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove obsolete Skipping()/SetSkip() from Connection (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove some code from IPBasedAnalyzer and children that was waiting for TCP to be implemented (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.679 | 2021-06-01 19:11:40 -0700

  * Replace toupper() usages in netbios decoding BIFs (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This avoids potential for locale-dependent results of toupper() by
    instead using a function that simply maps ASCII characters a-z to A-Z.

4.1.0-dev.676 | 2021-06-01 10:19:19 -0700

  * Integrate review feedback (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

    Fixes Coverity #1453273

4.1.0-dev.665 | 2021-05-26 08:07:26 +0200

  * Extend the file analyzer API to set source manually. (Robin
    Sommer, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.661 | 2021-05-24 15:03:54 -0700

  * Update Broker submodule for bump of embedded CAF to 0.18.3 (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.660 | 2021-05-24 12:38:44 -0700

  * Add type field to session::Key to help avoid collisions in map (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Move bad UDP checksum handling into adapter object (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Rename IPBasedTransportAnalyzer to SessionAdapter (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    This also also combines the old TransportLayerAnalyzer class into
    SessionAdapter, and removes the old class. This requires naming changes
    in a few places but no functionality changes.

  * Move building session analyzer tree out of analyzer::Manager (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Rework the packet flow through the IP-based analyzers (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Add new UDP packet analyzer, remove old one (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Move SessionManager::ParseIPPacket to IP analyzer's namespace (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Added skeletons for TCP/UDP/ICMP packet analysis plugins. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    This includes integration into the IP plugin and calling of the sessions code from each plugin.

4.1.0-dev.646 | 2021-05-18 11:47:25 -0700

  * Omit unneeded decimal points in modp_dtoa2() scientific notation output (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    For example, "1e-13" is now used instead of "1.e-13".

  * GH-1244: Change modp_dtoa2() to use scientific notation for small values (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This fixes problems where printing floating point numbers less than
    10^-6 output as "0.0".  Such numbers now use using scientific notation
    and preserve the value's actual floating point representation.

4.1.0-dev.643 | 2021-05-17 11:57:58 -0700

  * GH-1546: Make DictIterator() public, add copy/move operators (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Manual page updates (Henrik Kramselund Jereminsen)

4.1.0-dev.631 | 2021-05-11 09:26:37 -0700

  * Add unit tests to ZeekString.cc (Tim Wojtulewicz)

4.1.0-dev.628 | 2021-05-10 12:44:25 -0700

  * Add experimental support for translating Zeek scripts to equivalent C++ (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

    The generated C++ can then be compiled directly into the `zeek` binary,
    replacing use of the interpreter and producing better runtime performance.
    See `src/script_opt/CPP/README.md` for a guide on how to use this feature.

  * Add new "-a cpp" btest alternative (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * Add VectorVal methods to leverage ZVal representation (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * Fix backtrace BiF to avoid iterator invalidation & support compiled code (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.593 | 2021-05-10 10:17:34 +0100

  * Explain zeek-config options in help output (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Sort variables at top of zeek-config alphabetically (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Install Zeek's btest tooling with the distribution

    This creates $PREFIX/share/btest in the install tree, with the
    following folders:

    - scripts/ for the canonifiers
    - data/ for random.seed
    - data/pcaps for the test pcaps

    The pcaps can be skipped by configuring with --disable-btest-pcaps. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.587 | 2021-05-05 14:05:51 +0000

  * Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/topic/timw/session-coverity'

    * origin/topic/timw/session-coverity:
      Minor cleanup in IPAddr.h
      Fix a few Coverity warnings from the session manager work (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Minor cleanup in IPAddr.h (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Fix a few Coverity warnings from the session manager work

    - Be explicit about setting the copied flag in session::Key. Coverity seems
      confused about when that flag is set if it gets set by default
      initialization. This should fix 1452757 and 1452759.
    - Explicitly copy the fields in ConnKey instead of using memcpy. Fixes
      1452758. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.583 | 2021-05-03 18:21:33 -0700

  * switched RecordVal's to use std::optional for tracking missing fields (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * added constructors for directly building ZVal's (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.580 | 2021-04-30 18:29:22 -0700

  * Add missing zeek/ prefix to a telemetry header's includes (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.578 | 2021-04-30 09:42:26 -0700

  * GH-1534: Fix excessive coredump for duplicate enum definitions

    An adequate error message was previously reported for duplicate enum
    definitions, this just now prevents trying to access it as a constant in
    subsequent parsing and further generating a coredump. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.576 | 2021-04-30 09:40:18 -0700

  * Fixes to `decode_netbios_name` and `decode_netbios_name_type` BIFs

    Fixes to `decode_netbios_name`:

    * Improve validation that input string is a NetBIOS encoding
      (32 bytes, with characters ranging from 'A' to 'P').  This helps
      prevent Undefined Behavior of left-shifting negative values.
      Invalid encodings now cause a return-value of an empty string.

    * More liberal in what decoded characters are allowed.  Namely,
      spaces are now allowed (but any trailing null-bytes and spaces
      are trimmed, similar to before).

    Fixes to `decode_netbios_name_type`:

    * Improve validation that input string is a NetBIOS encoding
      (32 bytes, with characters ranging from 'A' to 'P').  This helps
      prevent Undefined Behavior of left-shifting negative values and
      a heap-buffer-overread when the input string is too small.
      Invalid encodings now cause a return-value of 256. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.573 | 2021-04-29 11:29:39 -0700

  * Rename ConnID and ConnIDKey (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove Session prefix from some session-related classes and files (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Move session code into new directory and into zeek::session namespace (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Move SessionKey into a separate file, added comments (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Review cleanup

    - Add constructors for ConnIDKey, remove BuildConnIDKey()
    - Rename protocol stats classes and move to implementation file
    - Rename "num" field of protocol stats to "active"
    - Explicitly delete copy operations for SessionKey
    - Change argument for ProtocolStats methods to const-reference
    - Make key validity methods in Session not be virtual
    - Rename Session::ClearKey and Session::IsKeyValid (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Rework stats to store handles to the counters (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Rename some connection-specific methods in Session and SessionManager (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Add deprecated version of Sessions.h (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Rename NetSessions to SessionManager

    This also includes:
    - Deprecating the NetSessions name.
    - Renaming the zeek::sessions global to zeek::session_mgr and deprecating the old name.
    - Renaming Sessions.{h,cc} to SessionManager.{h,cc}. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Store a single map of Sessions instead of split maps of Connections.

    This commit also includes:
    - Storing the transport protocol in ConnID and ConnIDKey to allow tcp and
      udp connections from the same IP/Port combinations. This happens in the
      core.cisco-fabric-path test, for example.
    - Lots of test updates. The reasons for these are two fold. First, with
      the change to only store a single map means that TCP, UDP, and ICMP
      connections are now mixed. When Zeek drains the map at shutdown, it drains
      each of those protocols together instead of separately. The second is
      because of how Sessions are stored in the map. We're now storing them
      keyed by the hash of the key stored by the Session objects, which causes
      them to again be in the map in a different order. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Convert session stats to use the new telemetry API (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Add test for get_conn_stats BIF before reworking session stats (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Add new Session base class

    This is mostly code copied from the existing Connection class, as that class now
    inherits from Session. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Move packet filter out of NetSessions (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Move some code out of NetSessions

    - TCPStateStats update when a session is removed was moved to Connection
    - Stepping Stone manager moved to a singleton object in SteppingStoneManager (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.557 | 2021-04-29 09:00:51 -0700

  * Add basic testing for Geneve protocol analyzer

    The added pcap file was downloaded from an attachment to
    https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/10193 without explicit
    license. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

  * GH-1517: Add Geneve decap support

    This patch adds the ability to decap Geneve packets to process the inner
    payload. The structure of the analyzer borrows heavily from the VXLAN
    analyzer. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.554 | 2021-04-28 13:45:53 -0700

  * Add a fatal error condition for invalid Dictionary insertion distances (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    When choosing poor/aggressive values for `table_expire_interval`,
    `table_expire_delay`, and/or `table_incremental_step` that tend to
    leave tables in state of constant table-expiry-iteration, the underlying
    Dictionary is never allowed the chance to complete remapping operations
    which re-position entries to more ideal locations (e.g. after
    reallocating the table to be able to store more entries).

    That situation not only leads to the Dictionary generally having a less
    efficient structure, but eventually, the lack of re-positioning may
    cause an insertion to calculate the new entry's
    distance-from-ideal-position to be a value requiring a full 16-bits or
    more (>=65535), but an entry only allows storing 16-bit distance values,
    with 65535 being a sentinel value that is supposed to indicate an empty
    entry.  Dictionary operations may start misbehaving if that's allowed to
    happen.

  * Fix using clear_table() within an &expire_func (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This previously crashed since clear_table()/TableVal::RemoveAll() left
    behind a stale iterator to the old table causing a heap-use-after-free
    when resuming table expiry iteration in TableVal::DoExpire().

  * Remove saving/restoring of value pointer after calling expire_func (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    It's no longer used for anything.  Previously, it was used to detect
    whether the expiry batch finished iterating the entire table or not, but
    that's now determined by directly checking if the iterator itself
    signifies the end of the table.

  * Avoid allocating a HashKey for no-op table expiry iterations (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.549 | 2021-04-28 13:09:30 -0700

4.1.0-dev.545 | 2021-04-26 11:14:49 -0700

  * GH-1483: Improve error for mismatched container initialization types (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    For example, trying to assign a vector, table, set, or record
    constructor expression to a global variable of a different type now
    provides a more explanatory error message than the previous
    "Val::CONVERTER" fatal-error and coredump.

  * Restore support for vectors with holes and improve test cases (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

    There's no longer breaking behavior changes to how vector-holes work from
    previous Zeek versions.

  * Fix cloning/copying vectors that contain holes (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * fix using ++/-- to vectors that contain holes (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.526 | 2021-04-16 16:03:06 -0700

  * GH-1506: Fix Broker unserialization of set/table function indices (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Zeek function types are serialized as a broker::vector, but the
    unserialization logic for Zeek set/table types that use a function for
    as an index incorrectly identified it as a composite-index, which also
    use broker::vector, rather than a singleton-index, and makes such
    unserialization fail.

    A general example where this failure can happen in practice is when
    trying to unserialize a connection record for which there's a
    Conn::RemovalHook, since that's a set[function], and a specific case of
    that is use of the Intel Framework in a Zeek cluster.

4.1.0-dev.524 | 2021-04-16 08:08:38 -0700

  * Move an assert() in input/Manager.cc to account for ValueToVal errors (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add test for config framework (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Fix similar issues with ValueTo* methods in the input framework (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * GH-1487: Handle error from ValueToVal instead of ignoring it (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.519 | 2021-04-15 17:44:16 -0700

  * Fix indexing of set/table types with a vector (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    That previously caused an internal error/crash

  * GH-1507: Tolerate junk data before SIP requests (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This allows for data that won't match a SIP request method to precede an
    actual request and generates a new 'sip_junk_before_request' weird when
    encountering such a situation.

  * GH-1503: Improve &expire_func compatibility type-checking (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Previously, incompatible &expire_funcs could mistakenly be used, such as
    when using that attribute on the unspecified table()/set()
    initializations/assignments, resulting in invalid function calls that
    eventually crash Zeek.

4.1.0-dev.512 | 2021-04-15 11:54:44 -0700

  * GH-1496: Fix build on armv7 architecture (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.510 | 2021-04-14 16:05:55 -0700

  * GH-1450: Improve printing/logging of large double/interval/time values

    The modp_dtoa/modp_dtoa2 functions aren't capable of handling double
    values larger than INT_MAX and fallback on using sprintf() in that
    situation.  Previously, the format string to that sprintf() was "%e",
    defaulting to a precision of 6, which is already too few digits to
    represent a number known to be larger than INT_MAX.  Now, an sprintf()
    is still performed for values larger than INT_MAX and still uses a
    scientific notation format, but in a way that uses as many decimal
    digits as needed to preserve information. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.508 | 2021-04-14 15:54:03 -0700

  * Add btest for unterminated pattern parsing error behavior

    And clarified the error message that it's more about finding an
    unterminated pattern than knowing for sure there's remaining pattern
    text spanning multiple lines. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1497: Support CRLF line-endings in Zeek scripts and signature files (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Escape non-printables in "unrecognized character" parser error messages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.504 | 2021-04-14 15:51:39 -0700

  * Add a check for null packet data in pcap IOSource

    Some libpcaps (observed in Myricom's) may claim to have read a packet,
    but either did not really read a packet or at least provide no way
    to access its contents, so this adds a check for null-data to
    handle those cases. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.501 | 2021-04-12 18:03:53 -0700

  * Change TableVal::ToMap() to return ValPtr-indexed maps (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add std::hash specialization for IntrusivePtr (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Move IntrusivePtr relational operators to zeek namespace

    Otherwise some cases relying on argument-dependent lookup (ADL) fail. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.490 | 2021-04-05 14:13:48 -0700

  * Add Telemetry API (C++/BIFs) for gathering runtime metrics (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

    This relies on the CAF metrics API/implementation and allows potential
    export to Prometheus.  These typical metric types are supported:
    counters, gauges, histograms, timers.

4.1.0-dev.475 | 2021-04-03 09:39:10 -0700

  * Increase timeout of plugins.reader btest (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * optionally hash original, not extended, form of records for profiling (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

    profile types associated with global initializations
    incorporate type name, if present, into type hash

  * fixed out-of-range enum constant: OpenFlow::INVALID_COOKIE (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

    (Though it's not currently an enum value)

  * Add method to add a fully-qualified enum name (module name included) (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * enum types track whether they've had values added via "redef" (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * Added TableVal::ToMap to retrieve a table's entire contents as a unordered_map (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * factoring out some replicated code in the parser (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * some micro-preening of parse.y; no semantic changes (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * for readability, removed explicit scoping in parse.y; no semantic changes (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.461 | 2021-04-01 14:11:44 -0700

  * function profiling rewritten - more detailed info, supports global profiling (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

    Hashes for Zeek script types are now done globally rather than
    per-function-body, which can save considerable time due to the complexity
    of some commonly used types (such as connection records).

    Hashing has been expanded to provide more robust distinctness
    (lack of collisions in practice) and determinism (consistently computing
    the same hash across compilations).

  * track whether a given function/body should be included/skipped for optimization (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.451 | 2021-03-31 11:58:08 -0700

  * Add ssh to Alpine Dockerfile for retrieving external test repos (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.449 | 2021-03-31 10:47:22 -0700

  * Change ci/init-external-repos.sh to use `base64 -d` (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The BusyBox version of `base64` does not have `--decode`.

4.1.0-dev.448 | 2021-03-31 10:29:17 -0700

  * Teach ci/init-external-repos.sh to consider user permissions (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Any errors while setting up external/private test repo should fail the
    task for PRs submitted by a user with write/admin permission.

4.1.0-dev.447 | 2021-03-31 09:55:05 -0700

  * CI: Add OpenSUSE Leap 15.2 (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Add CI task for Alpine Linux (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Separate stdout from stderr in btest baselines (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Redirecting both to the same file can show platform-specific differences
    (e.g. Alpine), likely due to different buffering defaults.

  * Remove newline-eof canonification attempt in diff-remove-timestamps (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change a <sys/errno.h> include to <errno.h> (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Some systems (e.g. Alpine) may warn that that the former is incorrect.

4.1.0-dev.440 | 2021-03-30 14:57:07 -0700

  * Fix incomplete-type for struct timeval (Andrew Benson)

    This fixes building on musl (e.g. Void, Alpine, etc.)

4.1.0-dev.438 | 2021-03-29 15:42:25 -0700

  * "balance" tests with multiple Zeek scripts to load the same elements (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * put global statements into a quasi-function to support script optimization (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.434 | 2021-03-29 13:18:18 -0700

  * Fix sign-compare compiler warning in coerce_to_record() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix maybe-uninitialized warning in ZVal::ToVal() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change RecordVal::GetFieldAs() to use std::vector::operator[] (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Since the method claims it's up to the user to ensure the field exists
    before calling, the extra bounds-checking done by std::vector::at()
    isn't needed.

  * Add RecordVal::AssignField() and use it in supervisor code (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This is a convenience method to assign a known record field value by
    field name.  May also be useful to reduce warnings from static analysis
    (e.g. Coverity) about not checking for negative return values before
    assigning since that now flows through a [[noreturn]] error path.

  * GH-960: Fix include order of bundled header files (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Previously, a system-wide installation of any bundled auxil/ software
    (like CAF) may get found/included rather than the bundled version and
    possibly break the build.

4.1.0-dev.427 | 2021-03-27 14:18:16 -0700

  * Update bundled CAF to 0.18.2 (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.426 | 2021-03-26 17:17:45 -0700

  * GH-1463: Rename supervisor_rotation_format_func to archiver_rotation_format_func (Vlad Grigorescu)

    And expose it for non-supervised setups.  Also deprecates the old name.

4.1.0-dev.423 | 2021-03-26 16:44:26 -0700

  * GH-1454: Heartbleed: fix substraction order. (Johanna Amann)

    Fixes incorrect/overflowed `n` value for `SSL_Heartbeat_Many_Requests`
    notices where number of server heartbeats is greater than number of client
    heartbeats.

    The larger number was substracted from the smaller one leading to an
    integer overflow. However, no information was lost due to everything
    also being present in the notice message.

4.1.0-dev.421 | 2021-03-26 16:39:22 -0700

  * Fix crash in Analyzer::ForwardPacket due to recursive analyzer calls. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    The change in 44f558df7b5a85bae40945de653bcb2448e0a7f4 that made analyzer_list
    a std::vector instead of a std::list doesn't take into account that in some
    cases an analyzer may chain back into itself, such as with UDP-in-UDP tunnels.
    In these cases, the second call to ForwardPacket may cause iterator
    invalidation, leading to a crash, so this reverts back to using an std::list.

  * Include git sha in request to benchmark host (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.417 | 2021-03-25 11:37:55 -0700

  * Fix missing `user_agent` existence check in smtp/software.zeek (Michael Dopheide)

    Without the check there can be extra reporter.log error noise, but
    no actual difference in functionality.

4.1.0-dev.402 | 2021-03-24 15:49:52 -0700

  * Add `bin_dir` setting for default zkg config file (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Which defaults to `${zeek_install_prefix}/bin`, same as what a
    standalone `zkg autoconfig` would use.

    Useful for customizing the default installation path for plugins.

4.1.0-dev.344 | 2021-03-23 16:29:27 -0700

  * Clean up iterator usage in Analyzer (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    The ``zeek::analyzer::analyzer_list`` type-alias changed from an
    ``std::list`` to ``std::vector`` which, in practice, is not expected to be
    used from plugins in API-incompatible way and may result in ~1-2% overall
    performance benefit.

4.1.0-dev.341 | 2021-03-18 12:45:04 -0700

  * ts fields in SMB logs now default to network_time() (Seth Hall, Corelight)

    This avoids a problem identified by amanbansal2709 in pull
    request #1288. I fixed it in a different way than that pull request
    by making sure the ts field is always set so that this isssue doesn't
    return in the future.

  * GH-1432: Use buffered IO for file extraction (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This can improve performance significantly: ~3.5x faster when tested on
    a large file passing data to the file analysis framework in small chunks
    of 20 bytes.

4.1.0-dev.316 | 2021-03-10 13:00:27 +0000

  * Fix potential mime type detection bug in IRC/FTP file_transferred event

    The files framework uses strncpy to copy data into the buffer that is
    used for IRC/FTP mime type detection. From all I can tell that means
    that, in these cases, currently mime type detection will be messed up if
    the data being passed in contains zero bytes. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * GH-1426: Improve handling of Broker data store creation failures (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Broker::create_master() and Broker::create_clone() now return
    a valid value even when there's a failure to open the backend database
    (e.g. SQLite filesystem error).  In that case, the returned value can
    still be passed into other data store operations, but they'll fail
    immediately with an error.  Broker::is_closed() can now also be used to
    determine whether the data store creation calls failed.

4.1.0-dev.258 | 2021-02-24 15:10:51 -0700

  * Minor Fedora 32/33 updates in CI

    - Switch Fedora package management from yum to dnf, the default
    - Minimize set of requested RPMs (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Add CentOS Stream 8 to CI

    There's no official Docker image on the Docker Hub, it's on quay.io:
    https://quay.io/repository/centos/centos?tab=tags

    At the moment, "Stream" and "Stream 8" are synonymous. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.255 | 2021-02-24 12:35:47 -0800

  * Support explicit disabling of file analyzers (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This adds various methods/BIFs the enable/disable file analyzers
    or query whether they're currently enabled.

4.1.0-dev.252 | 2021-02-23 12:01:52 -0800

  * "xform" btest alternative baseline update (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * Test baselines updates related to "unused assignment" warnings (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * USE ZEEK_USAGE_ISSUES environment variable in tests rather than -u/-uu (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

    Since it has precedence over the flag arguments and don't want btest
    alternatives to override it.

  * splitting out "usage" test suite alternative into -u/-uu versions (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * adding &is_used attribute for base scripts (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.228 | 2021-02-16 11:10:40 -0800

  * Fix `major_subsys_version` field in `pe_optional_header` event

    It was incorrectly set the same as the `minor_subsys_version` field
    of the `PE::OptionalHeader` record. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.225 | 2021-02-12 14:40:14 -0800

  * Fix CentOS 8 CI Dockerfile (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The "PowerTools" repoid changed to "powertools":
    https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=17920

4.1.0-dev.224 | 2021-02-12 11:18:32 -0800

  * GH-1398: Fix buffer overread in ascii formatter (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    When a text with an (escaped) zero byte was passed to ParseValue, only
    the part of the string up to the zero byte was copied, but the length of
    the full string was passed to the input framework.

    This leads to the input manager reading over the end of the buffer.

4.1.0-dev.220 | 2021-02-11 11:10:46 -0800

  * GH-1399: Remove RocksDB configure script options (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.219 | 2021-02-11 10:56:16 -0800

  * Add a script to cleanup the file listing before sending to Coveralls (Tim Wojtulewicz)

    GCC has a "feature" where it doesn't realize that files in the
    src/zeek/... tree are the same as files in the normal 'src/' tree. This
    leads the coverage script to send duplicates to Coveralls and pollute
    the display with them. The new script scrapes the intermediate output
    from lcov and de-duplicates anything in src/zeek/ to be just from src/.

4.1.0-dev.216 | 2021-02-08 13:06:07 -0800

  * Allow --parse-only to work with --usage-issues flag (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Use of --parse-only would previously exit before --usage-issues had a
    chance to analyze scripts and report any discovered issues and it can be
    useful to combine both flags for checking scripts for mistakes without
    actually executing any code.

    This also improves the behavior of --parse-only in combination with
    reporting problems in signature files (previously, it exited before
    even reading them).

4.1.0-dev.212 | 2021-02-05 10:56:23 -0800

  * Support for Zeek script "Reaching Definitions" (RD) analysis (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

    RD analysis invovles tracking the extent to which a given variable
    definition (assignment) can be visible elsewhere in the Zeek script.  The
    analysis works on local variables in function/event/hook bodies, but not
    across them.

    The code tracks two forms of RDs, "minimal" (what's guaranteed to reach a
    given point in a function body) and "maximal" (what possibly could reach).
    Upcoming script optimization will use the latter, but the former currently
    allows identification of places for which a value is used where it
    does not appear that it will necessarily be defined. Specifying the
    ``zeek -u`` option will generate warnings for instances where this holds
    for local variables. Specifying ``zeek -uu`` turns on additional
    expensive analysis to report instances where record fields might be used
    without having previously been set.

    The base scripts have some places where static analysis lacks sufficient
    power to tell that values are being used safely (guaranteed to have been
    identified). In order to enable users to employ ``zeek -u`` on their own
    scripts without being distracted by these instances, this change also
    includes a new attribute, ``&is_assigned``, which can be associated with a
    variable or a record field to inform Zeek's analysis that the script writer
    asserts the value will be set, suppressing the associated warnings.

    For the test suite, there's new ``btest -a usage`` alternative to exercise
    both ``zeek -uu`` and ``&is_assigned`` functionality.

4.1.0-dev.173 | 2021-02-03 11:16:04 -0800

  * GH-1389: Add VN-Tag packet analyzer that skips VN-Tag headers (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.171 | 2021-02-03 09:53:12 -0700

  * Prefix #includes of .bif.h files with zeek/

    This enables locating the headers within the install-tree using the
    dirs provided by `zeek-config --include_dir`.

    To enable locating these headers within the build-tree, this change also
    creates a 'build/src/include/zeek -> ..' symlink. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.169 | 2021-02-03 09:50:33 -0700

  * Bump macOS jobs in CI from 4 to 12 cores

    A recent Cirrus upgrade enables this and saves 4-5 minutes for the
    build and test jobs (combined), for both Catalina and Big Sur. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.158 | 2021-01-29 16:37:56 -0800

  * Fix language.init-in-anon-function btest due to changes to log filter predicates (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove deprecated log filter predicates for 4.1 (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    Update the logging framework tests: since hooks operate
    by name, they cannot be anonymous. I'm also dropping the &optional
    attribute from the status field, since here know that the values are
    actually defined, and access to an optional status field should
    normally be guarded by the existence test operator.

  * Remove deprecated Plugin::HookCallFunction (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove deprecated support for .bro script extension and BRO_ environment variables (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove deprecated ICMP events (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove some deprected methods/events from bif files (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove deprecated TYPE_COUNTER (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove all of the random single-file deprecations (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove all fully-deprecated files (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.146 | 2021-01-29 10:20:28 -0800

  * Skip negative integers in input framework where not type-permissible (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    Script-layer counts, when provided as negative integers in an input
    file, got cast to unsigned values because strtoull() does not complain
    about negative values. For example, input string "-1" would lead to
    value 18446744073709551615 (an all-ones 64-bit int) on x86_64. This is
    more likely to be an error than an intent to get very large,
    platform-dependent values, so these input lines are now skipped with
    according messaging in the reporter.log/stderr.

    This also affected ports: -1/tcp got cast to unsigned and only thrown
    out because PortVal rejects values > 65535, mapping them to 0. We now
    skip such inputs as well.

4.1.0-dev.144 | 2021-01-29 09:54:01 -0700

  * Fix various broken links in script documentation (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.137 | 2021-01-21 17:29:40 -0800

  * Update SSL consts (Johanna Amann)

    There have been a bunch of mostly TLS 1.3 related changes.

4.1.0-dev.135 | 2021-01-21 16:57:01 -0800

  * GH-1352: Added flag to stop processing SMTP headers in attached messages (Jon Oakley)

    Previously, header values from sub-entities could overwrite the top-level
    MIME entity values, causing the SMTP log to contain misleading information.

4.1.0-dev.132 | 2021-01-21 13:59:35 -0800

  * GH-1296: fix type-checks related to list-type equality (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    List-types as used in composite table/set indices, for example,
    previously had incorrect same_type() comparisons due to flattening
    of the list-type into a single type without checking whether the
    number and kind of types all match.

    This patch simply removes the flatten_type() call from same_type() since
    it was already contradicting/preventing a subsequent full-comparison
    between elements of two TYPE_LISTs.

    There was also a superfluous special-case of the `in` operator's
    type-checking for testing whether a record is in a table/set.  It's
    superfluous because the general case will already do the type-checking
    from MatchesIndex() after first wrapping the record operand in a
    ListExpr.  The previous logic was incorrectly relying on the
    flatten_type() for testing equality of a record-type against a
    list-type, whereas the general case correctly normalizes to testing
    equality of two list-types.

    The special-cased type-checking logic for assigning a record value to a
    table index during its initialization similarly needed minor
    re-organization in order to maintain the same error messages as before.

  * Guard against nullptr deref after AST-reduction consistency checks (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.128 | 2021-01-21 13:37:10 -0800

  * Install BTest with Zeek (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    Configuring with --disable-btest skips the installation. The main
    reason for doing this is that many Zeek packages come with testsuites
    that nearly always require btest, so providing btest out of the box
    makes sense. Note that zkg's recent additions to its PATH environment
    variable management mean that this btest instance is automatically
    found also when the Zeek installation's binary folder isn't in the
    path.

4.1.0-dev.125 | 2021-01-21 11:27:14 +0000

  * More precise type information in a config framework error message

    When an option's value is a reader-incompatible table or set, Zeek now
    renders the type as expressed in the script layer (e.g. "set[addr,addr]")
    as opposed to the internal type tag (which'd here be "table", including
    for sets). (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Explicitly don't support sets with multiple index types in input/config frameworks

    The input framework's Manager::IsCompatibleType() already rejected
    sets with multiple index types that aren't all the same (i.e. that are
    not pure). Pure ones (e.g. "set[addr,addr]") slipped through and could
    cause Zeek to segfault elsewhere in the config framework due to type
    comparison subtleties. Note that the ASCII reader can't read such sets
    anyway, so this method now rejects sets with any kind of index-type
    tuple.

    In the config framework, the script-level change handler has a risky
    conversion from any to set[bool], which can trigger segfaults when the
    underlying set's index is a type tuple. We now prevent this code path
    by ensuring it only applies to sets with a single index type.

  * Fix logo/website link in README (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.120 | 2021-01-19 21:08:11 -0800

  * Update Cirrus CI naming for MacOS images (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    The docs on https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/macOS/ changed from
    "osx_instance" to "macos_instance", so let's reflect that.

4.1.0-dev.118 | 2021-01-18 19:14:30 -0700

4.1.0-dev.116 | 2021-01-14 19:29:58 -0800

  * Implement standard-library-compatible iterators for Dictionary (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.114 | 2021-01-14 15:00:48 -0800

  * Add support for rewriting the ASTs for script functions in "reduced" form

    In reduced ASTs, expressions have only variables or constants for operands
    (no subexpressions - those are replaced by temporary variables). In
    addition, some expressions are transformed into alternatives (new specialized
    expressions, or in some cases new internal types of statements) to
    more directly encapsulate their operation.

    The functionality is enabled by using -O xform. You can dump the
    before-and-after ASTs using -O dump-xform (very large output!). The new
    command-line option --optimize-only=X restricts the processing to only the
    function named X, and also automatically turns on dump-xform.

  * Add new btest alternative for script transformation (xform) (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * split bifs.string_utils into a non-error test and an only-errors test (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

    To help control for differing error propagation

  * Add convenience function, obj_desc(), for accessing object descriptions (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * removed unused EventBodyList subclass (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * Add templated As() method to Val, use in various places we were using dynamic_cast (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Move ValImpl classes into detail namespace (Tim Wojtulewicz)

  * Some review cleanup in Val.cc (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Changes addressing pending issues per PR discussion (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.74 | 2021-01-14 11:57:48 -0700

  * Use xcode 11 on the Catalina CI image (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.71 | 2021-01-11 18:03:25 -0800

  * Add []-style variable-capture-list for Zeek lambda functions (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

    The previous behavior of automatically capturing references to variables
    outside a lambda's scope is now deprecated. An explicit capture list which
    also specifies the desired copy-semantics will be required when
    writing lambda functions that refer to local variables of an outer scope.

    Examples of the new capture-list syntax are described at
    https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/script-reference/types.html#type-function

  * nit: fixed some 0/1 values that should instead be false/true (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * factored some complexity of begin_func() into static functions for clarity (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * error propagation fix: don't complain about "unused" values that themselves are due to errors (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

  * corrected & reflowed some comments, plus a whitespace tweak (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

4.1.0-dev.52 | 2021-01-11 11:11:13 -0800

  * Remove unusable/broken RocksDB code and options (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The Broker RockSDB data store backend was previously unusable
    and broken, so all code and options related to it are now removed.

4.1.0-dev.51 | 2021-01-07 17:02:28 -0800

  * Add new TLS 1.3 constants. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix TLS 1.3 session resumption detection. (Johanna Amann)

    Now we detect TLS 1.3 session resumption by looking if both sides have
    the PSK extension set, which is much more exact than the previous
    approach.

  * Introduce ssl_probable_encrypted_handshake_message event (Johanna Amann)

    This event is raised for messages that (probably) are TLS 1.3 handshake
    messages, including finished. This allows scripts to examine handshake
    messages without having to handle all encrypted messages.

  * SSL Analyzer: ignore CCS for TLS 1.3 (Johanna Amann)

    In TLS 1.3, the ChangeCipherSpec message is meaningless; it only is
    included to convince middleboxes that the devices actually are speaking
    TLS 1.2. Nowadays some TLS 1.3 implementations also just don't send the
    packet.

    In a push to unify our handling of TLS 1.3 connections - ignore CCS and
    always go with application data packet counting to determine if
    connections are or are not encrypted.

  * GH-1323: TLS analyzer: change logic to track TLS 1.3 connection establishment (Johanna Amann)

    This commit changes the logic that is used to tracks connection
    establishment - and moves it from scriptland into the core.

    TLS 1.3 connection establishment is much more finnicky for us than the
    establishment of earlier versions - since we cannot rely on the CCS
    message anymore (which is meaningless and not sent in a lot of cases).

    With this commit, the ssl_encrypted_data message gets raised for
    encrypted TLS 1.3 handshake messages - which is much more correct than
    the behavior before that just interpreted them as plaintext messages.

  * logging/ascii: Atomically create .shadow files using rename() (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    A logger process being terminated/killed while in the process of creating
    a new .shadow file may leave an empty (invalid) one around. This in turn
    causes the logger to error and exit during startup.

4.1.0-dev.4 | 2020-12-15 08:00:44 -0800

  * Add test case to cover weird EDNS ECS parsing situations (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix EDNS ECS option parsing bugs (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    * The parsing of IPv6 addresses tried to fill a stack-buffer with as
      much data as supplied in the Option even if it was in excess of the
      desired prefix or maximum IPv6 address size.  This could result in an
      overflow of that stack-buffer.

    * The parsing of IPv4 addresses would overwrite the storage used for
      that address as many times as there were bytes in the Option in excess
      of the desired prefix length or maximum IPv4 address size.  This could
      cause the resulting IPv4 address to be derived from the incorrect
      data.

    * Upon encountering unexpected/excessive option-length or source-prefix
      parameters, the data pointer used for parsing was also not always
      advanced to the start of the next alleged option's data.  Assuming all
      other parsing code correctly guards against invalid input, there's no
      further harm from that other than the subsequent parsing being more
      likely to encounter unexpected values and emitting more Weirds.

    Otherwise, the global Broker manager object containing CAF/threading

  * Fix typo in table iterator invalidation test comment (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * GH-1328: Improve behavior of Dictionary iterator invalidation (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Previously, an assertion was triggered in debug builds upon any attempt
    to insert or remove a Dictionary entry while any iteration of that
    Dictionary is underway and also even in cases where Dictionary membership
    was not actually modified (and thus invalidates a loop).

    Now, it emits run-time warnings regardless of build-type and only when
    insert/remove operations truly change the Dictionary membership.  In the
    context of a Zeek script causing an invalidation, the warning message
    also now helps pinpoint the exact expression that causes it.

  * Install zkg as part of the Zeek distribution. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    - Add auxil/package-manager submodule as an optional build
      source. When the submodule is present, zkg gets installed into the
      Zeek installation's bin directory, its config file into etc/zkg, and
      its state into var/lib/zkg. Like zeekctl, zkg finds its own module
      independently of any PYTHONPATH. Installation via pip remains
      supported. You can skip zkg explicitly via --disable-zkg. See the
      NEWS update for details.

    - Establish a "zeek/python" subdirectory under libdir as the common place
      for Python modules in the Zeek distribution. This now separates out
      the Broker Python bindings, ZeekControl, and zkg's Python module.

    - Add configure flags to allow customizing this Python folder, in
      three ways: --python-dir, --python-prefix, and --python-home. These
      differ in the logic they automatically add to the path, and build on
      the logic already used in Broker.

    - Include a (commented-out) @load for zkg's packages folder in local.zeek.

3.3.0-dev.648 | 2020-12-12 13:39:28 -0800

  * Update Coverity Scan GitHub Action (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    * Remove old Python 2 vs. 3 workaround
    * Build CAF separately to prevent internal errors in Coverity tools

3.3.0-dev.645 | 2020-12-10 14:14:12 -0800

  * Fix message ordering of Broker messages (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

    Using two separate Broker subscribers for status events and regular
    messages introduces a race on the two objects. Even if Broker sends all
    messages in a particular (deterministic) order, Zeek may still process
    them in a different order as a result. Since several tests rely on a
    strict ordering of Broker events, these tests could fail sporadically.

    Using only a single subscriber for all Broker messages makes sure that
    Zeek observes all messages in the same order as Broker emits them.

  * Fix UB in shutdown of Broker manager (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

  * Migrate to CAF 0.18 (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.638 | 2020-12-09 17:29:03 -0800

  * Update Mozilla Root Store (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.634 | 2020-12-09 10:51:49 -0800

  * GH-1321: Prevent compounding of `connection_status_update` event timers (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Particularly for ICMP connections, a new timer got added every time a
    `connection` record was updated even if there was still a pending timer
    for that connection.

  * Update Debug.cc to use setsignal() wrapper (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    So as to prefer sigaction() over either sigset() or signal(), which are
    less favorable due to underspecification issues and some treating them
    as obsolete/deprecated.

3.3.0-dev.630 | 2020-12-07 16:52:52 -0800

  * Fix narrowing conversion compiler error in SMB error-response logic (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add tests for new SMB3 multichannel support (Vlad Grigorescu)

  * Fix SMB2 response status parsing. Fixes #1286 (Vlad Grigorescu)

3.3.0-dev.624 | 2020-12-07 18:17:34 +0000

  * Switch test baselines to canonified baselines

    All baselines are now using the new btest feature to save baselines in the canonified
    form (after the canonifiers are run). This should, hopefully, lead to less changes in
    the future - that are easier to diff.

    In addition, this cleans up a few small problems of the canonifiers which were over-eager
    in identifying some numerical and path values.

    We also use the new btest-diff --binary flag to identify binary files on which no
    canonifier (not even the default canonifier) is applied.

    (Christian Kreibich, Corelight with tiny additions by Johanna Amann, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.611 | 2020-12-07 09:42:37 -0800

  * Fix misassociation of Zeekygen-style comments within function scopes (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    All Zeekygen-style comments relate to entities at global scope, so those
    found within functions are now ignored instead of misassociated.

3.3.0-dev.609 | 2020-12-04 19:20:39 -0800

  * Remove an extraneous Zeekygen-style comment (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix the CMake 'dist' target of Zeek plugins to only run when outdated (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.604 | 2020-12-04 18:40:03 +0000

  * Sumstats: allow users to manage epoch manually

    This change allows users to specify an epoch length of 0, which means
    that the user manually has to finish the epochs. A new next_epoch
    function is introduced to allow users to manually end epochs.

    Addresses GH-348 (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Sumstats: epoch_finished was not called under certain circumstances

    In non-clustered mode, epoch_finished was not called when there was no
    data during the epoch.

    This behavior does not fit the documentation, and also is different in
    cluster-mode, where epoch_finished is, indeed, called after every epoch.

    This small change fixes this behavior. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.600 | 2020-12-03 18:02:22 -0800

  * Add a CI task for compiling with static broker/binpac (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.596 | 2020-12-03 09:35:42 -0700

  * Fix a couple of life-time issues when plugin loading fails.

    Reported by Coverity.

    Follow-up to #1179. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.593 | 2020-12-02 12:53:04 -0800

  * Add `count_to_double` and `int_to_double` bif functions (Yacin Nadji, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.590 | 2020-12-02 11:11:26 -0800

  * Update minimum required CMake to 3.5 (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Also now uses CMake's ENABLE_EXPORTS target property for the zeek
    executable to ensure symbols are visible to plugins.  Prior to CMake
    3.4, the policy was to export symbols by default for certain platforms,
    but later versions need either the explicit target property or policy.

3.3.0-dev.587 | 2020-12-01 10:17:42 -0700

  * GH-1184: Add 'source' field to weird log denoting where the weird was reported (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.585 | 2020-12-01 14:42:54 +0000

  * Retry loading plugins on failure to resolve to dependencies.
    Closes #1179. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.580 | 2020-11-30 14:07:39 -0700

  * Find correct zeek namespace in debug logger macros.

    These macros forward to functionality in `zeek::detail::debug_logger`
    and are not intended for customization. This patch fixes the macros to
    always use `::zeek::detail::debug_logger` as without the leading `::`
    lookup could happen in any potentially local namespace `zeek` which does
    not need to provide this symbol.

    This closes zeek/spicy#597. (Benjamin Bannier, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.576 | 2020-11-26 18:16:07 +0000

  * Remove Python2 compatibility logic. We now require at least Python 3.5.
    This includes script changes, improves the cmake logic to find python3,
    makes scripts explicitly call python3 and documentation updates.

    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove Fedora 31 (EOL) from CI (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.564 | 2020-11-24 15:23:50 -0800

  * Improve support for custom libdir locations (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    - Remove hardwiring of $ZEEK_ROOT/lib throughout the three and
      defaults the name of Zeek's library directory to the default on the
      given platform (e.g. lib64), via GNUInstallDirs.

    - Consistently use that lib directory, instead of two lib folders
      resulting when using a custom libdir.

    - Remove the old lib directory in the installation prefix, if one exists

    - Add --lib_dir to zeek-config (and sort its options a bit).

3.3.0-dev.561 | 2020-11-23 21:50:19 -0800

  * Move implementation of internal_{type,var,etc} methods back into global namespace.
    (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    This fixes an unknown symbol error if using those methods. They're defined
    as extern in the global namespace in Var.h, but Var.cc had their
    implementations defined in the zeek::detail namespace.

3.3.0-dev.559 | 2020-11-23 21:39:29 -0800

  * Simplify Debian/Ubuntu CI dependencies and setup (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

  * Reverts the SMTP regex change in dead3226a545e264072ced40284f86ac41528ba8. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    The regex change broke some of the external tests. I added some more cases
    to the regular email btest to hopefully cover all of the cases better.

3.3.0-dev.551 | 2020-11-17 15:01:04 -0700

  * Added unit tests for regex fix (christina23)

  * Improved regex for SMTP parsing (christina23)

3.3.0-dev.548 | 2020-11-17 13:32:57 -0800

  * GH-1033: BrokerStore <-> Zeek Tables: support complex indices (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This change adds support for complex indexes for sets and tables. With
    this change, sets with indexes like:

    set[string, count, count]

    will function. Before this change, Zeek raised an error message in these
    cases.

3.3.0-dev.546 | 2020-11-17 11:50:47 +0000

  * Fix memory leak in deprecated Analyzer::ConnectionEvent() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.543 | 2020-11-16 11:50:49 -0800

  * GH-352: Improve HTTP::match_sql_injection_uri regex (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Changes \x00-\x37 ranges to \x00-\x1f with assumption that the former
    was attempting to match ASCII control characters, but mistook an octal
    range for hex.  This change reduces some false positives.

3.3.0-dev.541 | 2020-11-16 11:22:00 -0800

  * Simplify ssh/main.zeek by using "ssh_server_host_key" for fingerprinting (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate "ssh1_server_host_key" parameters *e* and *p* (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    They are named such that *e* is actually the modulus, not the exponent.
    The replacement parameters are named *exponent* and *modulus* for
    clarity.

  * GH-1264: Implement "ssh_server_host_key" event (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This event provides host key fingerprints for both SSH1 and SSH2.

3.3.0-dev.537 | 2020-11-16 11:03:05 +0000

  * [SSH] Handle SSH version 1.99
    SSH can set in its identification a version 1.99 (SSH-1.99-xxx).
    That means the client/server is compatible with SSHv1 and SSHv2.
    So the version choice depends of the both side.

    1.99 : 1.99 => 2.0
    1.99 : 1.x  => 1.x
    1.99 : 2.0  => 2.O

    (see "Compatibility With Old SSH Versions" in RFC 4253) (Brevet Vivien)

3.3.0-dev.534 | 2020-11-12 14:31:10 -0800

  * Move UnknownProtocol options to init-bare.zeek (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Otherwise the `unknown_protocol` event cannot be used independently
    from `policy/mic/unknown-protocols.zeek`.

  * Coverity 1436183: Initialize packet_analysis::Manager fields (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1273: Change SizeExpr to yield "any" type when operating on "any" (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add enum_names() BIF to return names of an enum type's values (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add type_aliases() BIF for introspecting type-names of types/values (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change Type::type_aliases map to store IntrusivePtr (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    And deprecate Type::GetAliases() and Type::AddAlias() since they
    took raw pointers.  Now replaced with Type::Aliases() and
    Type::RegisterAlias().

  * Fix lookup_ID() BIF to return enum values (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Looking up an enum value from a string equal to its name previously
    returned "<no ID value>".

3.3.0-dev.524 | 2020-11-12 12:16:00 -0700

  * Move 'using namespace' declaration after other includes (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Use binpac.h as if it was an external dependency (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Fix includes of bif.h and _pac.h files to use full paths inside build directory (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove unnecessary include of NetVar.h from packet analysis plugins (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * GH-1079: Use full paths starting with zeek/ when including files (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Fix type clash fatal error with log filters that use $ext_func and $include/$exclude

    The logging manager's Manager::TraverseRecord(), called when adding a
    log filter to a stream, skipped any fields intoduced by a filter's
    $ext_func when such fields weren't mentioned in a $include restriction
    or mentioned in an $exclude restriction. This was inconsistent with
    Manager::RecordToFilterVals, used when actually writing log entries,
    which does include those values.

    The result was that the record indices descent in Manager::RecordToFilterVals
    expects to find only record values, when in fact only the record
    provided by ext_func is present. This leads to type mismatches and
    hard Zeek exits like this one:

    1300475173.475401 fatal error in zeek/share/zeek//base/init-bare.zeek, line 4810: Val::CONVERTER (string/record) (zeek)

    The fix makes ext_func's field additions decisive, meaning the
    filter's include/exclude lists don't apply to it. If a user really
    wants to override this, they can reset the filter's ext_func back to
    our no-op default.

    The included btest produces the above error when the fix is not present. (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * GH-1269: Fix LogAscii::enable_leftover_log_rotation crash in bad dirs

    Running with that option enabled inside a bad directory (e.g. lack of
    permissions) crashed due to not checking for failure of opendir(). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add CI support for Debian 10, Fedora 31 & 33, FreeBSD 11, Ubuntu 20.04 (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This also adds two environment variables to the Dockerfiles for the
    Debian/Ubuntu flavors to avoid stalling on user input when configuring
    tzdata.

3.3.0-dev.504 | 2020-11-09 10:56:09 -0700

  * Remove now-unused Packet::l2_valid field (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * GH-1186: Remove Packet::hdr_size and uses of it.

    This change also removes Packet::IP(), since Packet now contains an ip_hdr member
    that points at the IP header if it exists. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.501 | 2020-11-04 10:41:56 -0800

  * GH-1252: rename files with colons for Windows compatibility (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    A short-term measure so that the Zeek source tree can simply exist on a
    Windows filesystem.  For true support, the logic that decides/generates
    the filename format will need to change.

  * Use std::function instead of a function pointer in packet_analysis::Component (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.495 | 2020-11-02 12:03:52 -0700

3.3.0-dev.479 | 2020-10-23 12:25:15 -0700

  * GH-251 (revert): remove coercion-to-signed-integer for |x| expressions (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    For `|x|`, where `x` is an expression with an integral result, an
    implicit coercion of that result into signed `int` type no longer takes
    place.

    This was actually the behavior before Zeek 3.0 as well, but the attempt
    to prevent mistakes that easily result from integer literals in Zeek
    being unsigned like `|5 - 9|` causing an overflow/wraparound and
    yielding a very large number is not generally consistent since overflows
    are still generally able to happen in other ways and also in other
    contexts besides just absolute-values.  So the preference was to revert
    to a behavior that favors consistency.  For reference, see
    https://github.com/zeek/zeek/pull/251#issuecomment-713956976

3.3.0-dev.476 | 2020-10-22 15:59:56 -0400

  * Add an option to ignore packets sourced from particular subnets.

    It's implemented with a new set[subnet] option named ignore_checksums_nets.
    If you populate this set with subnets, any packet with a src address within
    that set of subnets will not have it's checksum validated. (Seth Hall, Corelight)

  * Update submodule(s) [nomail] (Jon Siwek, Corelight)


3.3.0-dev.467 | 2020-10-21 11:06:18 -0700

3.3.0-dev.454 | 2020-10-16 10:34:53 -0700

  * Change ICMP Neighbor Discovery option length storage to a uint16 (Vlad Grigorescu)

    This fixes an overflow in the calculation of option lengths in
    ICMP Neighbor Discovery messages.

3.3.0-dev.451 | 2020-10-16 07:09:43 +0000

  * Make event ordering deterministic

    NetControl::init and filter_change_tracking could basically be raised in
    random order. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Introduce generate_all_events bif and add option to misc/dump-events

    generate_all_events causes all events to be raised internally; this
    makes it possible for dump_events to really capture all events (and not
    just those that were handled).

    Addresses GH-169 (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Change "Cluster::Node$p" field to use "&default=0/unknown" (Seth Hall, Corelight)

    This effectively makes defining the listening port optional in the cluster
    node layout config, with "0/unknown" meaning the node is not pre-configured
    to listen for incoming connections from other cluster nodes.

3.3.0-dev.409 | 2020-10-13 13:32:18 -0700

  * Make it possible to pass command line options through to scripts. (Seth Hall, Corelight)

    A new ``zeek_script_args`` variable contains a list of arguments passed
    to a script.  E.g. either when explicitly executing Zeek like
    ``zeek -- myscript.zeek -arg1 -arg2``, or when using Zeek to interpret

  * GH-779: Add "udp-state" signature condition (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    It accepts "originator" or "responder" states as a way to enforce that
    the signature only matches packets in the associated direction.
    The "established" state is rejected as an error since it doesn't
    have a useful meaning like it does for the "tcp-state" condition.

3.3.0-dev.374 | 2020-10-07 10:44:11 -0700

  * Fix multipart MIME leak of sub-part found after closing-boundary (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    After detecting a closing-boundary for a given multipart MIME entity, it
    enters into an "end of data" state, however any subsequent boundary
    delimiter could still cause the allocation of a sub-entity object that
    is never released due to cleanup logic being bypassed upon finding the
    "end of data" state already reached.

    This change prevents allocation/processing of sub-entities after the
    "end of data" state is reached (e.g. from detecting a multipart
    closing-boundary).  This new behavior still aligns with RFC 2046
    expectations:

    "There appears to be room for additional information prior to the first
    boundary delimiter line and following the final boundary delimiter line.
    These areas should generally be left blank, and implementations must
    ignore anything that appears before the first boundary delimiter line or
    after the last one."

  * Btests for log filter policy hooks (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Btest baseline updates to reflect new logging policy hooks (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Migrate existing use of filter predicates to policy hooks (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

  * Support for log filter policy hooks (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This adds a "policy" hook into the logging framework's streams and
    filters to replace the existing log filter predicates. The hook
    signature is as follows:

        hook(rec: any, id: Log::ID, filter: Log::Filter);

    The logging manager invokes hooks on each log record. Hooks can veto
    log records via a break, and modify them if necessary. Log filters
    inherit the stream-level hook, but can override or remove the hook as
    needed.

    The distribution's existing log streams now come with pre-defined
    hooks that users can add handlers to. Their name is standardized as
    "log_policy" by convention, with additional suffixes when a module
    provides multiple streams. The following adds a handler to the Conn
    module's default log policy hook:

        hook Conn::log_policy(rec: Conn::Info, id: Log::ID, filter: Log::Filter)
                {
                if ( some_veto_reason(rec) )
                    break;
                }

    By default, this handler will get invoked for any log filter
    associated with the Conn::LOG stream.

    The existing predicates are deprecated for removal in 4.1 but continue
    to work.

  * GH-425: Avoid temporary value while coercing records already of the right type. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    The combination of this commit with the previous one now lets the examples
    in GH-425 all execute with the same performance.

  * GH-425: Optimize record constructor expression. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    We remove the inheritance from UnaryExpr because we know the type of the
    operand precisely and can skip a temporary when evaluating the expression.

  * Unify type comparisions for records. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    For records, same_type(r1, r2) would not check if the fields'
    attributes match as well. That seems like an oversight, and some
    callers of same_type() did indeed add that check on their end. This
    commit moves the check into same_type() itself. That generally doesn't
    seem make any differences except for a couple of places validating
    code, which we update a bit. That in turn leans to slightly different
    (better?) error messages for a couple of test cases.

3.3.0-dev.361 | 2020-10-06 10:13:37 -0700

  * logging/ascii: Support leftover log rotation in non-supervisor setups (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    Allow enabling leftover log rotation through
    LogAscii::enable_leftover_log_rotation and redef this for the
    logger node in a supervisor setup individually.

3.3.0-dev.359 | 2020-10-02 10:49:35 -0700

  * GH-1180: Add external dependency include paths to `zeek-config --include_dir` (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This helps ensure successful compilation of a plugin that includes a
    Zeek header which includes an external dependency header even if the
    plugin itself doesn't necessarily depend on that external library.

3.3.0-dev.357 | 2020-10-02 10:26:11 -0700

  * Switch one's complement checksum implementation (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Borrows the `in_cksum` code from tcpdump, which borrowed from FreeBSD.
    It handles unaligned data better and also unrolls the inner loop to
    process 16 two-byte values at a time versus 2 one-byte values at a time
    in the previous version.  Generally measured as ~1.5x faster in a
    release build.  The new API should generally be more amenable to any
    future optimization explorations since all relevant data blocks are
    available within a single call rather than spread across multiple.

3.3.0-dev.355 | 2020-09-29 17:08:44 -0700

  * Improve broker/ssl_auth_failure.zeek test (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    There was a race that previously may cause it to not truly test
    whether the connecting-process exited due to SSL authentication
    failure or just because the listening-process wasn't available yet
    (e.g. due to process scheduling variability).

3.3.0-dev.352 | 2020-09-25 15:09:29 -0700

3.3.0-dev.341 | 2020-09-24 08:16:45 -0700

  * Fix negative-value-left-shift undefined behavior in patricia trie (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve negation of ConstExpr (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    * Instead of creating a NegExpr for negation of a literal/constant,
      a ConstExpr is now created directly.

    * For negation of integer literals, there's now an additional check
      for whether the integer would be outside the range of possible 'int'
      values.  This can also help prevent the undefined behavior due to
      overflow as a result of trying to represent the minimum 'int' value of
      -9223372036854775808 as a literal in a script -- the unsigned value is
      cast to signed yielding INT64_MIN, then INT64_MIN is negated.

  * Avoid signed integer overflow when combining SMB header PID bits (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Such an overflow invokes undefined behavior.

  * Avoid unary negation of INT64_MIN in modp_litoa10 (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Overlow can occur in that case, which is undefined behavior.

  * Avoid double-to-int conversion overflows in modp_dtoa functions (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Those methods already had a fallback to use sprintf() for large values
    except:

    * The check-for-large-value was unnecessarily done after many
      operations that aren't relevant to the check and those operations can
      result in a conversion overflow (undefined behavior).

    * The check-for-large-value was using the literal value for a
      32-bit INT_MAX instead of just using INT_MAX.  For a platform where
      `int` is less than 32-bits, the same conversion overflow from the
      previous point could still occur (undefined behavior).

    * The check-for-large-value was not inclusive of INT_MAX.
      In a case where the conversion of INT_MAX itself to a double
      can't be represented exactly, it's implementation-defined whether
      the closest higher or closest lower representable-value is selected.
      If the higher value is selected, then a `double` value comparing equal
      to INT_MAX-as-converted-to-double would cause an overflow of an `int`
      upon conversion (undefined behavior).

  * Fix divide-by-zero in Entropy analyzer (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix divide-by-zero in stats/profiling memory usage calculation (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Allow to overwrite packet analysis mappings. (Jan Grashoefer)

  * Add SkipAnalyzer.

    This is WIP: The test case would require a new pcap or the possibility
    to overwrite analyzer mappings. The CustomEncapsulationSkip method and
    the corresponding options need to be removed. (Jan Grashoefer)

  * Suggested code improvements for packet analysis. (Jan Grashoefer)

  * Improve naming in packet analysis. (Jan Grashoefer)

  * Migrate all packet analyzers to new API. (Jan Grashoefer)

  * Further simplified the packet analysis API.

    This is still WIP and includes the following changes:
    * Dispatchers are now part of analyzers (moving dispatching logic from
      the manager to the analyzers)
    * All available analyzers are instantiated on start up
    * Removal of configuration class (Jan Grashoefer)

  * Move dispatching into packet analyzers.

    WIP that updates only the Ethernet analyzer. (Jan Grashoefer)

    Fedora 30 is EOL.

3.3.0-dev.275 | 2020-09-17 13:39:46 -0700

  * GH-1164: Fix incorrect RSTOS0 conn_state determinations

    The RSTOS0 `conn_state` label is documented as "Originator sent a SYN
    followed by a RST, never saw SYN-ACK from responder", but was previously
    applied to cases where no originator SYN exists, like a single RST-only
    packet. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.273 | 2020-09-17 13:11:44 -0700

  * GH-1119: add base/protcols/conn/removal-hooks.zeek

    This adds two new functions: `Conn::register_removal_hook()` and
    `Conn::unregister_removal_hook()` for registering a hook function to be
    called back during `connection_state_remove`.  The benefit of using hook
    callback approach is better scalability: the overhead of unrelated
    protocols having to dispatch no-op `connection_state_remove` handlers is
    avoided. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Avoid run-time cost of find-filtered-trace.zeek for live traffic (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove connection_successful and successful_connection_remove events

    Related to https://github.com/zeek/zeek/issues/1119 (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.3.0-dev.269 | 2020-09-17 11:42:38 -0700

  * GH-1155: Recursively check table index for unsupported types

    Previously, container types used within a table/set index were not
    deeply checked to ensure all constituents could be part of an index. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1159: Fix vector-of-interval multiplication/division arithmetic

    Those operations done between a vector-of-interval and a
    vector-of-arithmetic-type previously threw a runtime expression error
    due to an incorrect coercion being used internally. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve Reporter weird-sampling-whitelist getters/setters (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    - getter methods return const-ref
    - setter methods pass by value and std::move()
    - ranged-for loops over the whitelists access by const-ref

  * Fix memory leak caused by re-entering GTPv1 parsing (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    If the inner packet of a decapsulated GTPv1 frame maps to the same
    Connection as the outer packet and also contains another GTPv1
    encapsulation, the same GTPv1 analyzer attempts to parse the inner
    packet.  In the process, the inner parsing method overwrites pointers to
    memory resources the outer parsing method has not yet released and
    results in a memory leak.

  * Fix memory leak caused by re-entering AYIYA parsing (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    If the inner packet of a decapsulated AYIYA frame maps to the same
    Connection as the outer packet and also contains another AYIYA
    encapsulation, the same AYIYA analyzer attempts to parse the inner
    packet.  In the process, the inner parsing method overwrites pointers to
    memory resources the outer parsing method has not yet released and
    results in a memory leak.

  * GH-343: Change HTTP DPD signatures to trigger analyzer independent of peer state. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    This is to avoid missing large sessions where a single side exceeds
    the DPD buffer size. It comes with the trade-off that now the analyzer

    of both).

  * Fix a case where PktSrc gets processed twice in one runloop iteration

    For a non-live PktSrc, it had a special-case to be considered "ready"
    every iteration, but additionally every 1 in 100 iterations (the polling
    frequency), if there were no other "ready" IOSources, it would get added
    to the "ready" set a 2nd time.

    This commit completely excludes PktSrc from being processed during the
    1/100 runloop iteration where a Poll() happens.  That exclusion is
    desirable for a second reason: if reading a pcap happens to do its final
    Process() during that 1/100 polling-iteration and there's other
    IOSources ready to process like EventMgr/TimerMgr, those sources have
    logic to advance network-time to current-time if a PktSrc is no longer
    open.  So in such a case, PktSrc::Process() closes, then
    EventMgr::Process() sees there's no longer an active PktSrc and advances
    to current-time, then EventMgr::Drain() happens and may dispatch
    various events that were previous scheduled, with those events now
    unexpectedly seeing a network_time() returning current-time. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Adjust more btest timings (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve termination reliability/speed for brokerstore btests (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * General btest cleanup

    - Use `-b` most everywhere, it will save time.

    - Start some intel tests upon the input file being fully read instead of
      at an arbitrary time.

    - Improve termination condition for some sumstats/cluster tests.

    - Filter uninteresting output from some supervisor tests.

    - Test for `notice_policy.log` is no longer needed. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update NEWS about change in Dictionary implementation (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve Intel expire-item btest to be less time-sensitive (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve btests with unstable table/set output ordering

    Particularly, the final output order of a table/set is sensitive to
    order of input/insertions and some tests were converting
    std::unordered_{set,map} to Zeek table/set and iteration over those
    standard containers may not always loop through elements in the same
    order across all platforms. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update doc submodule (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Adjust a few btests that were unstable due to time-sensitivity (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix DNS script deleting a table element while iterating

    Doesn't typically cause any problems since the loop breaks after
    deleting, except there's now an assert in debug builds catching
    potential problems like this. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve a brokerstore btest to filter out Broker connection messages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Sort output of a few SumStats cluster tests

    The order of $epoch_result() function calls among all keys within a
    single epoch isn't consequential. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix extract_first_email_addr() to really return the first email

    The use of find_all() in extract_email_addrs_vec() extracted occurrences
    to an intermediate set and thus lost any sense of ordering.

    This changes extract_email_addrs_vec() to use find_all_ordered() and
    return all occurrences of email addresses found in the argument,
    included duplicates, with their order of occurrence preserved. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add find_all_ordered() BIF

    Operates similar to find_all(), except returns a vector instead of
    set to allow preservation of order/duplicates. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Extend external test suite canonifier with set-sorting logic

    Two new canonifiers: one to sort the contents of conn.log "service"
    field and another to sort the contents of any field of type "set". (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update btests/baselines for OpenDict compat

    Haven't checked different build configurations yet, but all except
    a few SumStats tests are stable for me now.  The external tests
    are also completely failing, but haven't looked at those yet. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1100: Fix reported body-length of HTTP messages w/ sub-entities (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The body-lengths of sub-entities, like multipart messages, got counted
    twice by mistake: once upon the end of the sub-entity and then again
    upon the end of the top-level entity that contains all sub-entities.
    The size of just the top-level entity is the correct one to use.

3.3.0-dev.50 | 2020-08-04 20:22:48 +0000

  * Fix incorrect conflict detection of namespaced-enum-names

    E.g. defining a `Foo::RED` enum name when a `GLOBAL::RED` identifier
    already exists would previously be treated as an error, even though the
    names don't truly conflict. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1080: Treat enum name re-use across different enum types as an error (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1080: Rename conflicting NetControl::DROP enum definitions

    ``NetControl::DROP`` had 3 conflicting definitions that could potentially
    be used incorrectly without any warnings or type-checking errors.
    Such enum redefinition conflicts are now caught and treated as errors,
    so the ``NetControl::DROP`` enums had to be renamed:

    * The use as enum of type ``Log::ID`` is renamed to ``NetControl::DROP_LOG``

    * The use as enum of type ``NetControl::CatchReleaseInfo`` is renamed to
      ``NetControl::DROP_REQUESTED``

    * The use as enum of type ``NetControl::RuleType`` is unchanged and still
      named ``NetControl::DROP`` (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The Contents_NetbiosSSN analyzer used a recursive message parsing
    function that determined the size of the next message from the input
    packet-data itself.  A packet containing a sequence of many small
    messages could cause a stack overflow since a recursion happened after
    processing each message.

  * Deprecate bro_srandom(), replace with zeek::seed_random().

    Avoiding zeek::srandom() to avoid potential for confusion with srandom() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add zeek::max_random() & fix misuse of RAND_MAX w/ zeek::random_number()

    In deterministic mode, RAND_MAX is not related to the result of
    zeek::random_number() (formerly bro_random()), but some logic was
    using RAND_MAX as indication of the possible range of values.  The
    new zeek::max_random() will give the correct upper-bound regardless
    of whether deterministic-mode is used. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate bro_random(), replace with zeek::random_number()

    Avoiding the use of zeek::random() due to potential for confusion
    with random(). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate bro_prng(), replace with zeek::prng()

    The type used for storing the state of the RNG is changed from
    `unsigned int` to `long int` since the former has a minimal range
    of [0, 65,535] while the RNG function itself has a range of
    [1, 2147483646].  A `long int` must be capable of
    [−2147483647, +2147483647] and is also the return type of `random()`,
    which is what zeek::prng() aims to roughly parity. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1076: Fix bro_srandom() to replace 0 seeds with 1

    The bro_prng() implementation cannot generate 0 as a result since it
    causes every subsequent number from the PRNG to also be 0, so use the
    number 1 instead of 0. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1076: Fix bro_prng() implementation

    The intermediate result of the PRNG used unsigned storage, preventing
    the ( result < 0 ) branch from ever being evaluated.  This could cause
    return values to exceed the modulus as well as RAND_MAX.

    One interesting effect of this is potential for the rand() BIF to
    return values outside the requested maximum limit.

    Another interesting effect of this is that a PacketFilter may start
    randomly dropping packets even if it was not configured for
    random-packet-drops. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1076: Fix use of getrandom()

    The availability and use of getrandom() actually caused unrandom and
    deterministic results in terms of Zeek's random number generation. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Broker Store table synchronizatio, (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    Zeek now supports synchronizing tables/sets across clusters using
    a backing Broker store. The same feature also allows persistent
    storage of data in tables/sets over Zeek restarts. This feature is
    implemented using the new ``&backend`` attribute.

    To synchronize a table over a cluster, you can, e.g., use:

        global t: table[string] of count &backend=Broker::MEMORY;

    This feature is documented in detail here:

        https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/frameworks/broker.html#broker-store-backed-zeek-tables-for-data-synchronization-and-persistence

    This feature is experimental and the syntax/specifics can change in the future.

3.2.0-dev.915 | 2020-07-17 16:10:46 -0700

  * Various deprecation fixes, reported by failed Spicy builds (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    - Add deprecated version of ID::SetType() that takes Type*
    - Add deprecated versions of zeek::set_location in the global namespace
    - Fix global namespace version of lookup_ID to return ID*

  * Add deprecated version of EnumType::GetVal() to return EnumVal* (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    Rename IntrusivePtr version to GetEnumVal

3.2.0-dev.911 | 2020-07-17 22:32:42 +0000

  * Fix race condition in ensure_dir()

    If something else created the dir between the stat() and mkdir(),
    it previously reported that as a failure. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix tokenize_string() to work with delimiters of length > 1. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.908 | 2020-07-17 10:19:07 +0000

3.2.0-dev.899 | 2020-07-14 00:02:05 +0000

  * Improve Broker store API's handling of invalid arguments

    * Some methods mistakenly returned a bool instead of QueryResult
      when passed an invalid `opaque of Broker::Store` handle.

    * Now generates a runtime exception for store_name() and is_closed()
      calls that pass an invalid `opaque of Broker::Store` handle as any
      returned value can't be reasonably used in any subsequent logic.

    * Descriptions of any invalid arguments are now given in the error
      message. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add zeek::detail::emit_builtin_exception() functions

    These work like zeek::emit_builtin_error(), but also throw an InterpreterException (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1024: fix crash on passing wrong types to Broker store API (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.894 | 2020-07-13 12:12:17 -0700

  * GH-1019: deprecate icmp_conn params for ICMP events

    Previously, a single `icmp_conn` record was built per ICMP "connection"
    and re-used for all events generated from it.  This may have been a
    historical attempt at performance optimization, but:

      * By default, Zeek does not load any scripts that handle ICMP events.

      * The one script Zeek ships with that does handle ICMP events,
        "detect-traceroute", is already noted as being disabled due to
        potential performance problems of doing that kind of analysis.

      * Re-use of the original `icmp_conn` record tends to misreport
        TTL and length values since they come from original packet instead
        of the current one.

      * Even if we chose to still re-use `icmp_conn` records and just fill
        in a new TTL and length value each packet, a user script could have
        stored a reference to the record and not be expecting those values
        to be changed out from underneath them.

    Now, a new `icmp_info` record is created/populated in all ICMP events
    and should be used instead of `icmp_conn`.  It also removes the
    orig_h/resp_h fields as those are redundant with what's already
    available in the connection record. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.892 | 2020-07-13 12:10:22 -0700

  * Fix wrong frame offsets for locals of alternate event/hook prototypes

    Local frame offsets were being assigned based on number of the alternate
    prototype's parameters, which may end up having less total parameters
    than the canonical prototype, causing the local value to incorrectly
    overwrite an event/hook argument value. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add deprecation expression to deprecated prototype/parameter messages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve "use of deprecated prototype" warning message

    The location information now points out the place of the deprecated
    prototype instead of the location where the ID was initially declared
    (which may not itself be a deprecated prototype). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Emit deprecation warning for use of &deprecated function parameters

    Particularly, this is meant for using &deprecated on canonical
    event/hook prototype parameters to encourage users to create handlers
    to another, non-deprecated prototype.  i.e. for canonical prototypes,
    we may not always want to put &deprecated directly on the prototype
    itself since that signals deprecation of the ID entirely. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.885 | 2020-07-10 11:20:41 -0700

  * Add more error checks to shadow log parsing (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    i.e. Coverity warns about possible use of ftell() negative return value

3.2.0-dev.884 | 2020-07-09 14:09:58 -0700

  * Add Supervisor::{stdout,stderr}_hook (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    These allow capturing/handling the stdout/stderr of child processes
    via Zeek scripts.

  * Add Log::rotation_format_func and Log::default_rotation_dir options (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    These may be redefined to customize log rotation path prefixes,
    including use of a directory.  File extensions are still up to
    individual log writers to add themselves during the actual rotation.

    These new also allow for some simplication to the default
    ASCII postprocessor function: it eliminates the need for it doing an
    extra/awkward rename() operation that only changes the timestamp format.

    This also teaches the supervisor framework to use these new options
    to rotate ascii logs into a log-queue/ directory with a specific
    file name format (intended for an external archiver process to
    monitor separately).

  * Allow Zeek function equality comparisons (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Equality between two functions acts like a pointer comparison.

  * Implement leftover log rotation/archival for supervised nodes (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This helps prevent a node from being killed/crashing in the middle
    of writing a log, restarting, and eventually clobbering that log
    file that never underwent the rotation/archival process.

    The old `archive-log` and `post-terminate` scripts as used by
    ZeekControl previously implemented this behavior, but the new logic is
    entirely in the ASCII writer.  It uses ".shadow" log files stored
    alongside the real log to help detect such scenarios and rotate them
    correctly upon the next startup of the Zeek process.

  * Move some supervisor structures to detail namespace (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    * StemHandle -> detail::SupervisorStemHandle
    * SupervisedNode -> detail::SupervisedNode
    * Supervisor::Node -> detail::SupervisorNode

  * Improve default supervisor stdout/stderr handling (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The stdout/stderr of child processes is now redirected over a pipe back
    to the supervisor process so that it can prefix the output with
    the name of the emitting node.

  * Factor Supervisor initialization data to separate struct from Stem (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Move ParentProcessCheckTimer to detail namespace (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.874 | 2020-07-08 17:46:20 -0700

  * reduce memory usage of ConnPolling (Justin Azoff)

    Instead of scheduling the event with the full 'connection' record,
    schedule it with the smaller 'conn_id' record.

3.2.0-dev.813 | 2020-06-26 16:25:34 +0000

  * Fix several issues with command-line option redefs

    * Variables of `string` type can now be set to an empty string

    * Trying to set a variable with non-`string` type to an empty value
      now emits an error instead of silently doing nothing

    * Providing an invalid identifier now emits an "unknown identifier"
      error instead of silently doing nothing (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix "possibly-truncated" compiler warning in BuildJSON snprintf() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-1025: allow copying/cloning of `opaque of Broker::Store`

  * Fix shadowed variable that breaks lookup_hostname(). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.804 | 2020-06-25 23:58:59 -0700

  * Extend dns_request, dns_reject, and dns_query_reply events with original_query param (Ryan Victory)

    Where the "query" parameter is downcased, the "original_query" is
    passed unmodified to these events.

    Added a policy/protocols/dns/log-original-query-case.zeek script that adds
    the original_query to the dns.log file as well.

  * Convert to using permissions to check for access to cirrus variables in benchmark script (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.798 | 2020-06-19 13:25:02 -0700

  * Remove last_access_time from TableEntryVal. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    Turns out - this was no longer used. And it takes up at least 8 bytes
    of space for every single table/set entry.

3.2.0-dev.796 | 2020-06-18 20:40:59 +0000

  * cmake: Make musl support more distro agnostic (Andrew Benson)

3.2.0-dev.794 | 2020-06-18 20:04:06 +0000

  * Minimize data published for expected FTP data channel analysis

    Previously, more data than could effectively be utilized by any remote
    Zeek was published (e.g. full list of pending commands or other
    transient state that may add up to non-trivial amount of bytes). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-998: Fix Reporter::conn_weird() to handle expired connections

    This introduces a new sampling state-map for expired connections to fix
    segfaults that previously occured when passing in a `connection` record
    to `Reporter::conn_weird()` for which the internal `Connection` object
    had already been expired and deleted.  This also introduces a new event
    called `expired_conn_weird`, which is similar to `conn_weird`, except
    the full `connection` record is no longer available, just the `conn_id`
    and UID string. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Place build file in explicit location for benchmarking to work correctly (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Update highwayhash submodule to upstream.
    This includes a patch by us, which fixes the compile on AARCH64.

  * Compare pcap_next_ex() result to PCAP_ERROR/PCAP_ERROR_BREAK (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-977: Improve pcap error handling (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Switches from pcap_next() to pcap_next_ex() to better handle all error
    conditions.  This allows, for example, to have a non-zero exit code for
    a Zeek process that fails to fully process all packets in a pcap file.

  * Remove not-useful code in iosource::Manager::OpenPktSrc (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.763 | 2020-06-10 16:34:31 -0700

  * Optimize Connection::RemovalEvent() for bare-mode usage (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    It was creating RecordVals even if they wouldn't be used by any event
    handler and that situation is common/expected for `zeek -b` mode.
    Normally, there's at least the tunnel scripts with a `new_connection`
    handler causing the connection RecordVals to be built.

3.2.0-dev.762 | 2020-06-09 15:19:15 -0700

  * Restrict Cirrus CI to only zeek repo's branches (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.761 | 2020-06-09 09:39:31 -0700

  * Prevent IP fragment reassembly on packets without minimal IP header (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The IP fragment reassembly process assumes a packet contains at least
    the minimum IP header, but such a check did not previously occur,
    resulting in a heap buffer over-read.  For example, a self-reported
    IPv4 IHL field with a value less than minimum IPv4 header length of
    20 bytes.  Such packets likely aren't routable on their own, but one
    can create an artifical pcap like that or possibly encapsulate it
    within another protocol to trigger this bug.

  * Fix potential stack overflow in NVT analyzer (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The NVT_Analyzer (e.g. as instantiated to support the FTP analyzer)
    uses a recursive parsing function that may only advance one byte at a
    time and can easily cause a stack overflow as a result.  This change
    replaces the recursive calls with equivalent iterative logic.

  * GH-999: Stop formatting DHCP Client ID Hardware Type 0 as MAC

    For `DHCP::ClientID$hwtype` fields equal to 0, the `hwaddr` field is
    no longer misformatted as a MAC and instead just contains the raw bytes
    seen in the DHCP Client ID Option. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.749 | 2020-06-08 11:22:45 -0700

  * Remove inline from some static KeyedHash members (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Coverity Scan builds currently encounter catastrophic error, claiming
    alignas requires use on both declaration and definition, so appears to
    actually not understand "static inline" in combo with alignas.

  * Improve Func.h inclusion (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Now forward declares some Broker types since Broker/CAF headers
    generally slow things down and also Coverity Scan currently has a
    catastrophic error on some CAF headers.

    Also a few other changes to EventHandler/BifReturnVal to reduce number
    of places that depend on Func.h.

  * Rename aux/ to auxil/ (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Since "aux" is not an allowed file/dir name on Windows.

  * GH-973: Fix the return type of topk_get_top()

    e.g. when using `string` elements it should return `vector of string`,
    not `vector of list of string` like it did before. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.740 | 2020-06-03 13:17:26 -0700

  * Deprecate Val(double, TypeTag) ctor, add TimeVal/DoubleVal subclasses

    This also updates all usages of the deprecated Val ctor to use
    either IntervalVal, TimeVal, or DoubleVal ctors.  The reason for
    doing away with the old constructor is that using it with TYPE_INTERVAL
    isn't strictly correct since there exists a more specific subclass,
    IntervalVal, with overriden ValDescribe() method that ought to be used
    to print such values in a more descriptive way. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.738 | 2020-06-02 18:13:50 -0700

  * GH-985: Fix descriptions of double_to_interval() return values (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The BIF was not returning an IntervalVal which has an overriden
    ValDescribe() method that allows for prettier printing like "6.0 secs"
    instead of just "6.0".

3.2.0-dev.736 | 2020-06-02 12:37:56 -0700

  * Change BroFunc ctor to take const-ref IntrusivePtr<ID> (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add version of Frame::SetElement() taking IntrusivePtr<ID>

    Expect the version using raw ID* could go away eventually, but this is
    convenience for the meantime. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change Scope/Func inits from id_list* to vector<IntrusivePtr<ID>> (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change Scope::GenerateTemporary() to return IntrusivePtr (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    was previously documented. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Switch plugin::Manager::HookCallFunction() to return IntrusivePtr

    The plugin::Plugin side of things is not (yet) changed. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Also deprecates the LocalHandler() and SetLocalHandler() methods,
    replaced with GetFunc() and SetFunc(). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

      which takes HashKey& and returns IntrusivePtr.

    * Updated the new TableVal Assign()/Remove() methods to take either
      std::unique_ptr<HashKey> or HashKey& as appropriate for clarity of
      ownership expectations. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add back in a deprecated TableVal ctor taking raw pointers (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Replace with GetField(const char*) and GetFieldOrDefault(const char*). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate RecordVal::LookupWithDefault() replace with GetFieldOrDefault()

    (The former was previously changed during this release cycle to return
    Intrusive pointer, but this just changes it back to return Val* and
    deprecates it). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate RecordVal::Lookup(int), replace with GetField(int) (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Use zeek::BifEvent:: for enqueue_ functions instead of BifEvent:: (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Replace deprecated usage of BifFunc:: with zeek::BifFunc::

    Names of functions also changed slightly, like bro_fmt -> fmt_bif.

    Should generally be unusual/unexpected to see somone calling these
    directly from C++ in their plugin, but since technically possible in
    previous versions, I also removed the "private" restriction on accessing
    the BifReturnVal member. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate names in BifConst, replace with zeek::BifConst

    Some Val* types are also replaced with IntrusivePtr at the new location (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate all BroType* in BifType:: namespace

      to be in NetVar.h

    * Lookup functions that used to be Var.h (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Trim the list of "global type pointers" from NetVar.h further

    Most of them are deprecated now, with usage sites now doing the lookup
    themselves. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate global Val pointers in NetVar.h

    All of these have fairly niche uses, so better maintained as
    lookup/static closer to the usage site. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate global type pointers in NetVar.h

    There's analogous IntrusivePtrs in zeek::vars (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Determines whether to require UDP server response before considering
    an active service to log in known_services.log.

  * Update known-services.zeek logic for "active" TCP services (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    To better check for only endpoints that either have observed a TCP handshake
    or else assumed to have done one in the past (partial connections, missed
    the handshake, but now see data/acks from server)

3.2.0-dev.559 | 2020-05-21 13:04:19 -0700

  * Make SendEvent callable from all threads

    This commit refactors the SendEvent call and moves it from the Input
    ReaderBackend to to MsgThread. This allows all other types of threads
    to access this functionality.

    This necessitated a few more changes. Most importantly, one of the
    ValueToVal methods was moved over to SerialTypes. Whereit arguably
    belongs - there was nothing that was input-framework specific in
    that method - and the functionality could come in useful in a number
    of cases. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Hash unification: address PR feedback (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Update architecture checks for highwayhash

    Now we use cmake to determine which compiler flags are set to
    determine which implementation of highwayhash to compile. This should
    be much more robust.

    Also - fix missing include on old ubuntus. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Add highwayhash in a more cmake-y way (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Remove highwayhash submodule.

    It is moving to 3rdparty... (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into topic/johanna/hash-unification (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Switch file UID hashing from md5 to highwayhash.

    This commit switches UID hashing from md5 to a highway hash. It also
    moves the salt value out of the file plugin - and makes it
    installation-specific instead - it is moved to the global namespace.

    There now are digest hash functions to make "static"
    installation-specific hashes that are stable over workers available to
    everyone; hashes can be 64, 128 or 256 bits in size.

    Due to the fact that we switch the file hashing algorithm, all file
    hashes change.

    The underlyigng algorithm that is used for hashing is highwayhash-128,
    which is significantly faster than md5. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Switch most internal md5 calls to digest calls.

    The places that used md5 basically already used it as a digest
    algorithm. Switching to a digest just means that the internal values
    used to not change between runs - which is actually wanted in these
    cases.

    This commit also removes our special cmake subdirectory. We don't expose
    highwayhash in headers anymore - so we can just treat it as an internal
    implementation choice that is not directly exposed to plugins. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Start refactoring hashing.

    This commit moves some of the hash datastructures and code from
    util.cc into Hash.cc - where it seems more appropriate.

    It also starts to make more Keyed hash functions available - still
    using siphash as the default 64 bit keyed hash, but also making
    128 and 256 bit highway hashes available.

    There already are a few other functions that are defined but not
    yet implemented - these will be "static" keyed hashes - which use
    an installation specific key. These will be used to, e.g., get
    rid of md5 hashing for the generation of file UIDs. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Introduce calculate_digest convenience function

    This function just calculates the chosen digest and returns the result
    in either the passed buffer, or in a static buffer. Basically a superset
    to the surprisingly popular internal_md5. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Remove the siphash->hmac-md5 switch after 36 bytes.

    Currently, siphash is used for strings up to 36 bytes. hmac-md5 is used
    for longer strings.

    This switch-over is a remnant of the previous hash-function that was
    used, which apparently was slower with longer input strings.

    This change serves no purpose anymore. I performed a few performance tests
    on strings of varying sizes:

    For a 40 byte string with 10 million iterations:

    siphash: 0.31 seconds
    hmac-md5: 3.8 seconds

    For a 1080 byte string with 10 million iterations:

    siphash: 4.2 seconds
    hmac-md5: 17 seconds

    For a 18360 byte string with 10 million iterations:

    siphash: 69 seconds
    hmac-md5: 240 seconds

    Hence, this commit removes the use of hmac-md5.

    This change causes reordering of lines in a few logs.

    This commit also changes the datastructure for the seed in probabilistic/Hasher
    to get rid of a type-punning warning. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Fix plugin compile problems with highwayhash

    The way this is included is still hacky as hell - but now all tests pass. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Replace siphash with Google implementation

    This adds the entirety of the highwayhash implementation of Google.
    This includes siphash as well as severl highwayhash variants - which
    are faster.

    This first commit only switches out the siphash implementation. All
    hashes that are generated are exactly the same as before. However, this
    does make all other hashes available to be used by us.

    I did some performance tests vs the previous siphash implementation by
    running the 2009-M57-day11-18 trace 100x through both cases. The average
    runtime was virtually the same (within 0.014 seconds of each other).

    Note that the way that I included the highwayhash implementation in our
    cmake setup is... well, let's say hacky. This definitely needs to be
    changed a bit before including this in a real build. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    "-fsanitize=fuzzer" (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change --enable-fuzzing to --enable-fuzzers

    Since it controls whether to build the fuzzer targets, not whether those
    fuzzer targets actually use a fuzzing engine. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add standalone driver for fuzz targets

    Useful for cases that don't need to use a fuzzing engine, but just run
    the fuzz targets over some set of inputs, like for regression/CI tests.

    Also added a POP3 fuzzer dictionary, seed corpus, and README with
    examples. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add basic structure for fuzzing targets

    General changes:

    * Add -D/--deterministic command line option as
      convenience/alternative to -G/--load-seeds (i.e. no file needed, it just
      uses zero-initialized random seeds).  It also changes Broker data
      stores over to using deterministic timing rather than real time.

    * Add option to make Reporter abort on runtime scripting errors (Jon Siwek, Corelight)


3.2.0-dev.486 | 2020-05-11 11:11:51 -0700

  * Limit rate at which MMDB error/status messages are emitted

    If there's some bad state we can be in where MMDB lookup/open operations
    consistently fail, then the volume of associated reporter messages can
    get overwhelmingly large especially if a lookup operation is being done
    for each network connection.

    This adds a limit of an arbitrary 20 messages every 5 minutes, which
    should be enough information to understand the overall
    open/close/lookup-failure pattern. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.484 | 2020-05-08 11:50:54 -0700

  * Change timer_list in BroList to be an unordered list. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    This type is used by Conn and Analyzer to hold onto timers being added and
    removed. We don't expect the elements in those lists to maintain an order
    as the list is being modified.

  * Add ability for List to be ordered/unordered (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    This fixes a "bug" with List where remove_nth() can be an O(n) operation
    when it doesn't need to be. remove_nth for lists that don't necessarily
    need to keep an order can be an O(1) operation instead.

  * Add unit testing for List (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Fix bug with List where replace() doesn't work with non-pointer types (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.478 | 2020-05-08 11:47:38 -0700

  * Added examples to set_to_regex comments (James Lagermann, Corelight)

  * Unbreak build on Fedora 32 (gcc 10.0.1) (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    It requires cstdint in a few more headers.

3.2.0-dev.475 | 2020-05-07 17:15:23 -0700

  * GH-958: Fix crash when trying to redef non-existing enum (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.473 | 2020-05-06 10:40:09 -0700

  * Revert addition of final modifier to JSON formatter (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.471 | 2020-05-06 10:00:58 -0700

  * Fix global buffer over-read in POP3 analyzer (Justin Azoff, Corelight)

  * Fix SSL scripting error leading to access of unitialized field (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Reported by Justin Azoff

  * Remove outdated comment on set_to_regex. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    We can add patterns at runtime since 2.6.

3.2.0-dev.467 | 2020-05-04 18:00:35 -0700

  * GH-952: Correct spelling of DCE/RPC operation string NetrLogonSameLogonWithFlags
    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.466 | 2020-05-04 17:50:14 -0700

  * Add network_time_init() event. (Jan Grashoefer)

    This event is generated upon first initialization of network_time.

3.2.0-dev.461 | 2020-05-04 17:08:46 -0700

  * Avoid scheduling multiple inactivity timers (Justin Azoff and Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Also updated language.expire_subnet btest which is unduly sensitive to
    timer-related changes

3.2.0-dev.459 | 2020-05-01 17:46:20 -0700

  * Extend CI config to cover building with libmaxminddb support (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Ensure time continues moving forward if a pcap source is suspended (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.455 | 2020-05-01 09:44:30 -0700

  * GH-938: fix IO loop iterations sometimes skipping offline pcap sources (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.451 | 2020-04-29 16:28:34 -0700

  * Organized and added to the shipped file identification signatures. (Seth Hall, Corelight)

     - Added ISO 9660 disk image

     - Created new files for categorizing signatures better.
       - executable.sig - Executable (and bytecode) files.
       - java.sig - Java related files (class/jar, etc).
       - programming.sig - Mostly scripting language identification

3.2.0-dev.447 | 2020-04-29 15:55:03 -0700

  * GH-713: Fixed misc/stats.zeek skipping a log entry on termination (Brittany Donowho)

3.2.0-dev.445 | 2020-04-29 15:25:03 -0700

  * Add warning message for unknown Broker statuses (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    There's now a couple placeholder/unimplemented status values in Broker
    related to upcoming routing features that we don't want to handle
    explicitly for compatibility reasons, but also don't want the compiler
    warning about unhandled values in the switch.

3.2.0-dev.443 | 2020-04-28 17:10:38 -0700

  * GH-941: Fix build when configured to use libmaxminddb (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.441 | 2020-04-27 13:34:22 -0700

  * Fix a few more IntrusivePtr deprecation warnings (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Fix cloning of TypeType values (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.437 | 2020-04-27 19:30:24 +0000

  * GH-854: provide access to original HTTP/MIME header names

    The "http_header" event now has an "original_name" parameter that allows
    access to the original header name (the "name" parameter reamins the
    same as before: it's the uppercased header name).

    The "mime_header_rec" record type now also includes an "original_name"
    field to similarly provide access to original header name in the
    following events: "http_all_headers", "mime_one_header", and
    "mime_all_headers". (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove error message from empty bloomfilter lookups

    If a bloomfilter doesn't have a type, that just means no
    bloomfilter_add() has been called yet, so seems undesirable to emit an
    error for a lookup against something that's known to be empty. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * unused variables found via use-def analysis (plus an indentation micro-nit) (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.431 | 2020-04-27 12:09:30 -0700

  * Update various BIFs to return IntrusivePtr (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.428 | 2020-04-24 16:19:45 -0700

  * Deprecate returning Val* from BIFs (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate binpac::string_to_val (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate binpac::bytestring_to_val, replace with binpac::to_stringval (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update deprecated BifEvent::generate_* usages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate Connection::Event and Analyzer::Event methods

    And update usages to the "EnqueueEvent" methods. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate BuildConnVal() methods and update usages to ConnVal()

    The later being a new method that returns IntrusivePtr (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update all BIFs to return IntrusivePtr instead of Val* (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update deprecated ValManager::GetPort usages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update deprecated ValManager::GetEmptyString usages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update deprecated ValManager::GetCount usages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update deprecated ValManager::GetInt usages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update deprecated ValManager::GetBool usages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update deprecated ValManager GetTrue/GetFalse usages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate all ValManager "Get" methods

    Alternate methods that return IntrusivePtr are available in similarly
    named methods that omit the "Get" prefix. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change BIFs to return a wrapper object

    That allows returning either Val* or IntrusivePtr<T>.  The former could
    eventually be deprecated, but it's used extensively at the moment. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)


3.2.0-dev.412 | 2020-04-22 10:43:39 -0700

  * Fix buffer over-read in Ident analyzer (Max Kellermann)

3.2.0-dev.410 | 2020-04-21 10:25:29 -0700

  * Remove "connection_external" event (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This event was forgotten in our broccoli cleanup. It cannot be
    raised by anything anymore

3.2.0-dev.405 | 2020-04-16 15:38:46 -0700

  * Remove ineffective &default in netcontrol cluster event handler args (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.404 | 2020-04-16 14:12:20 -0700

  * GH-895: Remove use of Variable-Length-Arrays (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.402 | 2020-04-16 13:00:59 -0700

  * Add default function for Kerberos constant-lookup-tables (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * check for the existance of f?$conns in file_sniff event in policy/protocols/ssl/log-hostcerts-only.zeek
	  (SG)

  * Update README.md to fix the logo and one of the links (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.396 | 2020-04-14 15:45:54 -0700

  * A few minor cleanups in Dict (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.394 | 2020-04-14 15:29:00 -0700

  * Fix a confusing variable name shadowing (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.392 | 2020-04-14 11:06:04 -0700

  * Fix Stack Overflow in POP3_Analyzer::ProcessRequest. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    The VLA can overflow given a large enough string. As a small fix, this
    commit gets rid of the VLA and assigns the password directly to the
    target string.

    This was reported by Matteo Rizzo (Google).

3.2.0-dev.391 | 2020-04-13 14:59:50 -0700

  * Add warning for ineffective &default arguments in handlers

    For event/hook handlers that had a previous declaration, any &default
    arguments are ineffective.  Only &default uses in the initial
    prototype's arguments have an effect (that includes if the handler
    is actually the site at which the declaration occurs). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix frame size allocation of alternate event/hook handlers

    When the only existing handler doesn't use the full argument list, still
    have to ensure the full frame is allocated because all arguments get set
    regardless. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Emit error for alternate event/hook prototype args with attributes

    Argument attributes are only allowed in the canonical prototype. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve alternate event/hook prototype matching

    This fixes it to again allow the old behavior of matching a handler
    against the canonical prototype as long as all argument types, but not
    necessarily names, match. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Allow alternate event/hook prototype declarations

    The alternates must be some subset of the canonical prototype (the one
    that's first declared) and allows users to define handlers for any
    such prototype.  Example:

        # Prototype declarations
        global my_event: event(s: string, c: count);
        global my_event: event(c: count);
        global my_event: event();

        # Handler definitions
        event my_event(s: string, c: count) { print s, c; }
        event my_event(c: count) { print c; }
        event my_event() { }

    This allows handlers to consume a subset of the arguments or even
    re-order them.  This makes it easier to either extend an existing
    event/hook's arguments and/or deprecate usages of certain prototypes. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix Broker topics used to uniquely identify cluster nodes

    Node-specific topic prefix subscriptions/publications now add a trailing
    slash like "zeek/cluster/node/<name>/".  Without the trailing slash,
    messages attempting to target "proxy-10" may also be sent to "proxy-1"
    since subscription matching is prefix-based. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update submodule(s)

     [nomail] (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix include in X509Common.h

    Give full path to Analyzer.h, so that X509Common.h is include-able by
    plugins. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)


3.2.0-dev.382 | 2020-04-09 13:17:03 -0700

  * Remove 'using namespace std' as well as other using statements from headers.

    This unfortunately cuases a ton of flow-down changes because a lot of other
    code was depending on that definition existing. This has a fairly large chance
    to break builds of external plugins, considering how many internal ones it broke. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.378 | 2020-04-09 08:47:44 -0700

  * Replace most of the uses of 0 or NULL to indicate null pointers with nullptr.
    This change does not change any calls to syscalls, in the interest of passing
    what the API for those calls says to pass. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.372 | 2020-04-08 14:00:28 -0700

  * Lazy-initalize some of the fields in Frame to reduce size (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Set InternalHashTag to a uint16_t so CompositeHash doesn't have a gap in it.

    Resizes CompositeHash from 32 bytes to 24 bytes. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Mark constants in List constexpr so they don't actually take up space in created objects

    This resizes List from 24 bytes to 16 bytes. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Reorder some class variables to fill in gaps in structure packing (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Mark classes as final, where appropriate. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    These classes were recommended by gcc's -Wsugggest-final-types as places where
    large numbers of virtual functions could be optimized away.

3.2.0-dev.360 | 2020-04-07 14:12:27 -0700

  * Add "udp_content_ports" option

    Any port in that set found as either source or destination port
    of a UDP packet will cause the "udp_contents" event to be raised. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add new "udp_content_delivery_ports_use_resp" option

    This controls whether ports given by "udp_content_delivery_ports_orig" and
    "udp_content_delivery_ports_orig" are in terms of the UDP packet's
    destination port or by the Connection's "responder" port (the former is
    the unchanged default behavior). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.357 | 2020-04-07 13:43:38 -0700

  * Fix connection duration thresholding

    Connection durations were being compared "less than" instead of "greater
    than" the desired duration threshold as provided to
    set_current_conn_bytes_threshold() or
    ConnThreshold::set_duration_threshold() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.355 | 2020-04-07 12:05:17 -0700

  * Fix using patterns stored as table/set indices

    Pattern values used as table/set indices are stored in serialized form
    using just the pattern text, but re-creating the value from that didn't
    fully initialize/compile the regex matcher after (re-)creating it from
    that pattern text. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.353 | 2020-04-06 17:27:35 -0700

  * Improve parsing of RDPEUDP/RDPEUDP2 (Anthony Kasza, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.338 | 2020-04-02 18:29:23 -0700

  * Add RDP over UDP analyzer (Anthony Kasza, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.336 | 2020-04-02 15:03:04 -0700

  * Fix uses of GetBool in bifs to use GetTrue/GetFalse (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Change Sessions::dump_this_packet to a bool (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.332 | 2020-03-31 15:34:52 -0700

  * GH-725: fix logic for finding a lambda's usage of outer IDs (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change record field anonymous functions to use lambda expressions

    There was an alternate syntax to assign anonymous functions to record
    fields that was never migrated to use the new lambda expression
    machinery (and so didn't allow referencing variables in outer scope):

        type myrec: record {
            foo: function(a: string);
        };

        local o = "o";
        local mr = myrec($foo(a: string) = { print a + o; });

    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.329 | 2020-03-31 08:48:10 -0700

  * Mark input/output message classes as final, since nothing should be inheriting from them (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Add missing override specifier to a number of methods, remove virtual from some as well (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Add override specifier to Configure() method in almost all of the internal plugins (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.325 | 2020-03-31 07:04:59 +0000

  * Fix bug in intel framework letting deletes of mixed-cased entries
    fail. (Antonio Nappa, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.322 | 2020-03-31 06:44:57 +0000

  * A large number of functions had return values and/or arguments
    changed to use ``bool`` types instead of ``int``. (Tim
    Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.320 | 2020-03-30 14:09:23 -0700

  * GH-887: improve GRE/ERSPAN parsing of non-IPv4/IPv6 inner payload

    This changes the decapsulation logic for GRE/ERSPAN payloads to re-use
    existing Layer 2 parsing logic that already handles things like 802.1Q
    tags correctly before going on to process the inner IPv4/IPv6 payload. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix ERSPAN III optional sub-header parsing (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Many small cleanups of Expr.cc (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove unused cq queue code (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Add a "reserved" field to tcp_hdr record

    This record is available by handling either raw_packet or new_packet
    events. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-878: Make RocksDB usage opt-in and add --enable-rocksdb configure flag (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.300 | 2020-03-27 11:48:46 -0700

  * Func::DescribeDebug: move a NumFields() call out of loop (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Use const-ref parameter for zeek::val_list_to_args()

    It ended up being used a bit more than initially expected and this
    is closer to the style we're generally aiming for. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix missing IntrusivePtr.h include and ambiguous ODesc::Add call (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove TimerMgr arg from event queuing/scheduling methods

    It's not useful for anything since there's only ever a single TimerMgr. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate Analyzer::ConnectionEvent()

    And update usages to Analyzer::EnqueueConnEvent() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate file_analysis::File::FileEvent methods using val_list args

    And update usages to the overload that takes a zeek::Args instead. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate Connection::ConnectionEvent methods

    And update usages to Connection::EnqueueEvent (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate EventMgr::QueueEventFast() and update usages to Enqueue() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate EventMgr::QueueEvent() and update usages to Enqueue() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Deprecate Func::Call(val_list*, ...)

    The version taking a vector of intrusive pointers should be used
    instead.  A variadic version is also added that forwards all arguments. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Use vector<IntrusivePtr<Val>> for Func::Call and Event queuing args

    This change may break BIFs that use @ARGS@, @ARG@, or @ARGC@ since their
    types have changed. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leak in Zeek when-statement bodies with runtime errors (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Change TableVal::RecoverIndex() to return IntrusivePtr (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Use IntrusivePtr in TableVal::CallExpireFunc (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leak when runtime error occurs in a Zeek for-loop (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Enable leak checks for btests that produce runtime exceptions

    These were previously reporting leaks due to various allocations not
    getting cleaned up during the stack unwind, but at the current state of
    the transition toward IntrusivePtr usage, theses tests no longer leak. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.280 | 2020-03-24 13:49:43 -0700

  * Add test case for binpac flowbuffer frame length parsing bug (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.277 | 2020-03-20 11:29:36 -0700

  * Initialize RecordVal default fields when redef'd (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    If a RecordVal had been created, but later its RecordType redef'd to
    contain fields with &default, those fields were incorrectly left
    uninitialized.

  * GH-857: fix redefining record types used to index tables (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This change tracks all TableVals created at parse-time whose index
    depends on a given RecordType.  Should that RecordType be redef'd, those
    TableVals are immediately rebuilt such that they are valid to
    subsequently use in either parse-time initializations or eventually in
    any arbitrary run-time expression.

  * Change RecordVals to get resized at time of RecordType redef (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Opposed to unconditionally checking all RecordVals whether they need to
    be resized after parsing ends.

3.2.0-dev.273 | 2020-03-20 10:05:21 -0700

  * GH-865: fix parsing of SMB NegotiateContextList

    * The compression capability was incorrectly set to 0x0004 instead of 0x0003

    * The padding was 4-byte instead of 8-byte aligned and also the spec.
      does not strictly require the padding for the last item in the list.

    * Add a default case to handle parsing of unknown context types. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.271 | 2020-03-17 22:52:40 -0700

  * Scope: store IntrusivePtr in `local` (Max Kellermann)

  * Scope: pass IntrusivePtr to AddInit() (Max Kellermann)

  * DNS_Mgr: use class IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Scope: use class IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Attr: use class IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Expr: check_and_promote_expr() returns IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

    Instead of returning a pseudo-boolean integer, it now returns a
    referenced object or nullptr on error.  The old API was very error
    prone because of its obscure reference counting semantics.

  * Frame: use class IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Val: RecordVal::LookupWithDefault() returns IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: RecordType::FieldDefault() returns IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

    Fixes memory leak in EventHandler::NewEvent().

  * Val: TableVal::Delete() returns IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: base_type() returns IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: init_type() returns IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: merge_types() returns IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: use class IntrusivePtr in VectorType (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: use class IntrusivePtr in EnumType (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: use class IntrusivePtr in FileType (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: use class IntrusivePtr in TypeDecl (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: make TypeDecl `final` and the dtor non-`virtual` (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: use class IntrusivePtr in TypeType (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: use class IntrusivePtr in FuncType (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: use class IntrusivePtr in TypeList (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: use class IntrusivePtr in IndexType (Max Kellermann)

  * Val: use class IntrusivePtr in class TableVal (Max Kellermann)

  * Val: use class IntrusivePtr in class TableEntryVal (Max Kellermann)

  * CompHash: return IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: return IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * Val: add TableVal::Assign() overload with IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * zeekygen/IdentifierInfo: use class IntrusivePtr more (Max Kellermann)

  * Func: use class IntrusivePtr (Max Kellermann)

  * GH-845: reference `id_list` before passing to new `BroFunc` (Max Kellermann)

    Passing the `id_list` pointer to `BroFunc` transfers ownership of the
    contained `ID` instances, because `~BroFunc()` unreferences them.
    Therefore, we need to increase the reference counters for each
    `BroFunc` instance to fix the use-after-free bug.

3.2.0-dev.237 | 2020-03-17 16:54:35 -0700

  * Cleanup in iosource/Packet (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Add ability for packet sources to flag a packet's l2 or l3 checksum as valid.

    This lets packet source plugins implement handling of hardware checksum
    offloading, if available. Setting the flags will skip the internal checksumming
    for either layer 2 and/or layer 3. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.230 | 2020-03-12 13:33:09 -0700

  * Introduce X509 certificate caching.

    This change introduces caching of X509 certificates. If a certificate is
    encountered more than 10 times in a minute, it will be cached for the future
    (until it is not seen for more than a minute). The caching means that the
    base scripts cache the certificate information and use cached information
    to raise events.

    This means certificates do not have to be repeatedly parsed; furthermore
    the events are passed "recycled" Vals (so data is not repeatedly copied around).

    This new feature is highly configureable - see the x509 main.zeek for full
    information. You can both change the timeouts, disable the feature, or
    even stop X509 events from being raised (by hooking X509::x509_certificate_cache_replay).

3.2.0-dev.221 | 2020-03-11 11:21:20 -0700

  * Made additional MySQL fixes. (Vlad Grigorescu)

    1) There are a couple more places where the new protocol uses and OK
    packet instead of the deprecated EOF.

    2) With > 255 results, we could end up in an situation where the uint8
    sequence number would wrap, and we'd naively think it'd be a new
    handshake.

    Now, we track the previous sequence number, and assume overflow if it
    was 255 previously and 0 now.

    We also reset the previous sequence number to 0 in various packets
    that we'd expect at the end of other commands.

  * Add support to MySQL for deprecation of EOF packets. (Vlad Grigorescu)

    From the docs: "As of MySQL 5.7.5, OK packes are also used to indicate
    EOF, and EOF packets are deprecated."

    The client sets a capability flag (CLIENT_DEPRECATE_EOF) to indicate
    that it expects an OK instead of an EOF after the resultset rows.

  * MySQL analyzer whitespace cleanup (Vlad Grigorescu)

  * Fix EOF detection in the MySQL protocol analyzer. (Vlad Grigorescu)

    The MySQL documentation
    (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/page_protocol_basic_eof_packet.html)
    warns us that "You must check whether the packet length is less than 9 to
    make sure that it is a EOF_Packet packet."

    While we were doing this in two places, we were comparing the total
    packet length, which includes the 4-byte header. Changed to compare to
    13 instead.

3.2.0-dev.159 | 2020-02-26 19:51:24 -0800

  * Pop global frame stack on exception. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    When changing this code for 3.0.0, the code-flow changed significantly.
    One of the changes lead to exception being re-thrown from Call - which
    leads to the function cleanup not always being run. While the Unref of
    the framepointer was (correctly) moved into the catch block, the global
    frame stack was not cleaned up - and contains an invalid pointer after
    encountering an interpreter exception.

    This small commit pops the stack and removes the framepointer that was
    pushed onto it before re-throwing the exception.

    I also think that this change (re-throwing the exception) breaks the
    Zeek debugger in significant ways (you cannot debug a script that causes
    a Runtime error anymore).

3.2.0-dev.157 | 2020-02-26 10:04:32 -0800

  * IntrusivePtr: overload std::swap() (Max Kellermann)

  * Expr: remove unused default constructors and `friend` declarations (Max Kellermann)

  * Remove useless override: RecordAssignExpr::Eval() (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: don't pass reference to pointer to MatchesIndex() (Max Kellermann)

    No implementation modifies the pointer value.  To guard against this,
    this commit changes `&` to `const`.

  * Expr: don't pass reference to pointer to check_and_promote*() (Max Kellermann)

    The function never modifies the pointer value.

    check_and_promote_expr() is left untouched because it really does
    modify the pointer.

  * Scope: simplify PList access, use pop_back() and back() (Max Kellermann)

  * Improve formatting of doubles that are close to integers

    Now checks for approximate floating point equality so that more doubles
    get properly disambiguated from integers (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve HTTP version number comparisons

    Previous use of floating point comparisons was not always stable. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add a 32-bit task to Cirrus CI config (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Replace va_list fmt() overload with vfmt()

    Using an overload that takes a va_list argument potentially causes
    accidental misuse on platforms (e.g. 32-bit) where va_list is
    implemented as a type that may collide with commonly-used argument
    types.

    For example:

        char* c = copy_string("hi");
        fmt("%s", (const char*)c);
        fmt("%s", c);

    The first fmt() call correctly goes through fmt(const char*, ...) first,
    but the second mistakenly goes through fmt(const char*, va_list) first
    because variadic function overloads have lower priority during overload
    resolution and va_list on a 32-bit system happens to be defined as a
    pointer type that can match with "char*" but not "const char*". (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Format tables indexed by patterns consistently across 32-bit/64-bit

    Uses a full 64 bit integer for length values regardless of actual size_t
    to get consistent results between either 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Format interval values consistently across 32-bit/64-bit platforms (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.2.0-dev.106 | 2020-02-24 17:07:10 -0800

  * ScannedFile: Identify already scanned files by device and inode (Arne Welzel)

    Zeek scripts located on separate filesystems, but sharing the same inode
    number leads to scripts not being loaded. The reason is that a `ScannedFile`
    is only identified by `st_ino` which is not enough to uniquely identify a
    file in a system.

  * GH-808: Add ZEEK_VERSION_NUMBER definition to zeek-config.h (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This is the result of (major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch), for example
    3.1.2 becomes 30102.  This definition may be helpful for external code
    that requires conditional compilation to support multiple Zeek
    versions with differing APIs.

  * Type: remove unnecessary enum typedefs (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: use C++ initializers (Max Kellermann)

  * Type: move code from BroType::BroType() to constexpr functions (Max Kellermann)

    Prepare to inline the constructor, which will one day be `constexpr`
    (requires moving the `std::string name` field somewhere else).

  * Type: remove useless BroType destructor (Max Kellermann)

  * Obj: disallow copying BroObj (Max Kellermann)

    Copying a BroObj is dangerous, and should only be done with dedicated
    (virtual) methods which are implemented by all derived classes.  This
    commit avoids unintentional copies.

  * Obj: use C++ initializers (Max Kellermann)

  * Obj: make `no_location` constexpr (Max Kellermann)

    This ensures that the variable is initialized at compile time and may
    allow the compiler to apply more initializations.

    These methods are not meant to be overridden.

  * CompHash: use class IntrusivePtr for the `type` field (Max Kellermann)

  * IntrusivePtr: replace the "add_ref" parameter with tag structs (Max Kellermann)

    Using a runtime parameter is obscure and error-prone.  Avoiding
    error-prone code and getting reference counting right is the whole
    point of this class.

  * IntrusivePtr: remove reset(), nobody uses it (Max Kellermann)

    This method mimicks std::unique_ptr::reset(), but adds an obscure
    "add_ref" parameter which is error prone.  Since nobody uses this
    method, and this method is all about dealing with raw pointers which
    we shouldn't be doing, let's remove it.

  * IntrusivePtr: remove ordering operators (Max Kellermann)

    These violate the C++ standard because comparing pointers to unrelated
    objects is undefined behavior.

  * IntrusivePtr: rename detach() to release() (Max Kellermann)

    Follow the C++ standard library conventions (here: `std::unique_ptr`).

  * IntrusivePtr: move nullptr initializer to field declaration (Max Kellermann)

    This allows "defaulting" the default constructor, and guarantees that
    all constructors really initialize the field to a legal value.

  * Fix memory leaks in BinaryExpr::Eval() error conditions (Max Kellermann)

  * Fix potential future memory leak in HTTP analyzer (Max Kellermann)

    This isn't really a memory leak because ParseRequest() never fails,
    but if it one day "learns" to fail, the `request_method` allocation
    will leak.

    The reason behind this one is that without a real variable name, the

    for the small window when they were valid. If the intention is to profile
    the method where they were defined, this doesn't actually happen.

3.1.0-dev.597 | 2020-02-07 15:25:56 -0700

  * plugin/Manager: migrate to std::string_view (Max Kellermann)

  * util: optimize the normal_path() common case

    Speeds up Zeek startup by 2%. (Max Kellermann)

  * util: pass string_view to without_bropath_component() (Max Kellermann)

  * module_util: make GLOBAL_MODULE_NAME constexpr

    This allows the compiler to hard-code pointers to the string without
    looking up a global variable at runtime. (Max Kellermann)

  * Scope: convert Scope::Lookup() and others to template

    Allows passing rvalue references which eliminates unnecessary
    std::string copies.

    This speeds up Zeek startup by 1-2%. (Max Kellermann)

  * Scope: Vars() returns const reference

    No caller wants to modify the container. (Max Kellermann)

  * Anon: remove unnecessary {map,vector}::clear() calls

    The destructor will do this automatically. (Max Kellermann)

  * Dict: make the destructor non-virtual (Max Kellermann)

  * Obj: make the Location constructors `constexpr` (Max Kellermann)

  * Obj: remove unused fields Location::{timestamp,text} (Max Kellermann)

  * Obj: remove Location::delete_data, nobody ever sets it

    This allows removing the destructor completely, making the class
    trivially-destructible. (Max Kellermann)

  * Obj: make the Location destructor non-virtual

    Nobody ever derives from this class.  This removes an indirect call
    and allows inlining the destructor.

    This speeds up Zeek startup by 1-2%. (Max Kellermann)


3.1.0-dev.584 | 2020-02-07 14:12:17 -0800

  * Improve kerberos analyzer address and event handling

    Adds a weird, "invalid_kerberos_addr_len", for invalid kerberos host
    address lengths and also fixes a memory leak when processing KRB_KDC_REQ
    and KRB_KDC_REP messages for message types that do not match a
    known/expected type. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.582 | 2020-02-07 09:46:00 -0800

  * Add environment variable to disable supervisor SIGKILL

    For use in btests since SIGKILL can otherwise bypass the usual
    btest-bg-wait timeout mechanism and make reason for test failures less
    obvious. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix a btest's race condition by handling Pcap::file_done (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add Pcap::file_done event

    It signals when a pcap file is done being processed. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve btest timeouts

    * Generally increase timeouts for tests that have recent transient
      failures

    * Change any test that relied on `btest-bg-wait -k` since that's never
      going to play with with CI systems.  Instead, we always need to have
      a well-defined termination condition in the test itself (and most
      already did, so didn't really need the `-k` flag anyway). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.577 | 2020-02-07 09:43:48 -0800

  * Use 2 btest retries for CI (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.575 | 2020-02-07 09:31:50 -0800

  * GH-780: Prevent log batches from indefinite buffering

    Logs that got sent sparsely or burstily would get buffered for long
    periods of time since the logic to flush them only does so on the next
    log write.  In the worst case, a subsequent log write could never happen
    and cause a log entry to be indefinitely buffered.

    This fix introduces a recurring event/timer to simply flush all pending
    logs at frequency of Broker::log_batch_interval. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.571 | 2020-02-07 10:33:16 +0000

    Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.570 | 2020-02-06 14:58:34 -0800

  * add &on_change attribute for sets/tables

    The &on_change attribute allows users to specify a function that is
    called when a set or table is changed via a direct insertion/delete/change
    or element expiry.

    Example:

    function set_change(t: set[string], tpe: TableChange, idx: string)
        {
        print "set_change", idx, tpe;
        }

    global s: set[string] &on_change=set_change;

  * Remove presumed ownership of HeartbeatTimer (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    threading::Manager is currently never deleted, but if that ever changes,
    deleting the stored HeartbeatTimer pointer would be a double-free
    since TimerMgr owns it.

  * Set threading::Manager terminating state (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Coverity CID 1417429

  * Remove unused HeartbeatTimer member: do_expire (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-773: Make EventMgr an IOSource so that events interrupt kevent waits (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.546 | 2020-02-05 10:51:35 -0800

  * Change threading formatter errors to warnings. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This change standardizes threading formatter error handling and moves
    the remaining error calls to be warnings instead.

    This is in line with already existing code - in most cases warnings were
    raised, only a few cases raised errors. These cases do not differ
    significantly from other cases in which warnings are raised.

    This also fixes GH-692, in which misformatted lines prevent future file
    parsing.

    This commit also moves the FailWarn method that is used by both the
    config and the ascii reader up to the ReaderBackend. Furthermore it
    makes the Warning method of ReaderBackend respect the warning
    suppression that is introduced by the FailWarn method.

  * Update NEWS about plugin breakage from the include-file changes (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.542 | 2020-02-04 14:05:19 -0700

  * UID, ..: un-inline methods to reduce header dependencies

    Only 1% build time speedup, but still, it declutters the headers a bit.

     16240inputs+8887152outputs (1931major+48728888minor)pagefaults 0swaps (Max Kellermann)

  * include cleanup

    The Zeek code base has very inconsistent #includes.  Many sources
    included a few headers, and those headers included other headers, and
    in the end, nearly everything is included everywhere, so missing
    #includes were never noticed.  Another side effect was a lot of header
    bloat which slows down the build.

    First step to fix it: in each source file, its own header should be
    included first to verify that each header's includes are correct, and
    none is missing.

    After adding the missing #includes, I replaced lots of #includes
    inside headers with class forward declarations.  In most headers,
    object pointers are never referenced, so declaring the function
    prototypes with forward-declared classes is just fine.

    This patch speeds up the build by 19%, because each compilation unit
    gets smaller.  Here are the "time" numbers for a fresh build (with a
    warm page cache but without ccache):

    Travis environment doesn't offer enough memory for running ASan very
    well, but Cirrus has it covered anyway.

  * Change requested memory in Cirrus CI config (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The ASan build does require quite a bit more, but also the default
    release builds should do ok with slightly less.

3.1.0-dev.521 | 2020-01-31 14:18:17 -0800

  * util: optimize expand_escape() by avoiding sscanf() (Max Kellermann)

    sscanf() is notoriously slow, and the default scripts have lots of hex
    escapes.  This patch can reduce Zeek's startup time by 3-9%.

3.1.0-dev.519 | 2020-01-31 13:19:09 -0800

  * util: optimize tokenize_string() and normalize_path() (Max Kellermann)

    This patch can speed up Zeek startup by 10-25%.

    Adds a new tokenize_string() overload which returns string_views and
    changes existing tokenize_string() and normalize_path() to use string_view
    arguments.

3.1.0-dev.510 | 2020-01-31 11:20:28 -0800

  * Remove extra fmt() in a reporter->Error() call (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * parse.y: Properly set location info for functions (Arne Welzel)

    When defining a function, remember the location where the function header
    was and restore it before calling `end_func()`. Inside `end_func()`, a
    `BroFunc` object is created using the current global location information.

    This came up while experimenting with zeek script profiling and wondering
    why the locations set for `BroFunc` were "somewhere" in the middle of
    functions instead of spanning them.

  * Desc: move realloc() call out of the loop (Max Kellermann)

  * PacketDumper: remove unused types (Max Kellermann)

3.1.0-dev.503 | 2020-01-31 11:00:32 -0800

  * Show percentage of packets dropped in the final process output (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove concept of multiple timer managers (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    - All timers are now handled by a single global timer manager, which
      simplifies how they handled by the IOSource manager.

    - This change flows down a number of changes to other parts of the code.
      The timer manager tag field is removed, which means that matching
      connections to a timer manager is also removed. This removes the ability to
      tag a connection as internal or external, since that's how the connections
      where differentiated. This in turn removes the `current_conns_extern` field
      from the `ConnStats` record type in the script layer.

  * Have terminate_processing() raise SIGTERM instead of calling the signal handler directly (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * PktSrc iosource changes to match the new IOSource API (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Broker manager changes to match the new IOSource API and loop architecture (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * DNS_Mgr changes to match the new IOSource API and loop architecture (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Threading changes for the new loop architecture (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    - threading::Manager is no longer an IOSource.

    - threading::MsgThread is now an IOSource. This allows threads themselves
      to signal when they have data to process instead of continually checking
      each of the threads on every loop pass.

    - Make the thread heartbeat timer an actual timer and let it fire as
      necessary instead of checking to see if it should fire

  * Add Trigger manager for managing triggers created by things like 'when' statements

    - Adds new trigger namespace (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    - Adds trigger::Manager class as a new IOSource for keeping track of
      triggers and integrating them into the loop. Previously the loop relied on
      the event manager Drain() method to process all triggers on every loop, but
      now that the loop actively waits for events to occur, triggers would not
      fire when they needed to. Adding them as part of the loop ensures they're
      checked.

  * Make TimerMgr an IOSource (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    - This allows the loop to check what the next timeout is and use that as
      the basis for the timeout of the poll

    - This commit also removes the TimerMgr::Tag type, since it causes a name
      clash with other code in IOSource

  * Modify IOSource Manager to implement new loop architecture (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    - Removes entire FindSoonest method that includes all of the calls to select() for checking for ready sources

    - Removes FD_Set checking against IOSources

    - Adds system for registering and unregistering file descriptors from
      IOSources. This allows individual sources to mark themselves as ready to be
      checked by the loop as they become available.

    - Adds entirely new loop architecture based on checking the IOSources for
      when their next timeout is, and then waiting for either that timeout or
      when the next source is ready. This also implements the polling based on
      what the OS supports, instead of just calling select() on all platforms.
      Currently it supports kqueue, epoll, and plain poll.

    - Adds system for pinging the loop to force it to wake up

  * Minor amount of code cleanup in Pcap IO source (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * IOSource API changes for new loop architecture (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    - Removed GetFD and NextTimestamp methods

    - Removed concept of idle sources

    - Renamed Init to InitSource to avoid a name clash with the thread code

    - Added GetNextTimeout method

    This commit also removes the FD_Set file since it's no longer used

  * Type and variable usage cleanup in Net.h (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Remove #include of some iosource files from Net.h (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Only allow a single trace file (-r) or interface (-i) option on the command-line (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Add a new supervisor framework that enables Zeek to operate
    clusters of processes itself without any external help. (Jon
    Siwek, Corelight)

    The Supervisor framework provides an entirely new deployment mode
    for Zeek, one that supervises a set of Zeek processes that are
    meant to be persistent. A Supervisor automatically revives any
    process that dies or exits prematurely and also arranges for an
    ordered shutdown of the entire process tree upon its own
    termination. This Supervisor mode for Zeek provides the basic
    foundation for process configuration/management that could be used
    to deploy a Zeek cluster similar to what ZeekControl does, but is
    also simpler to integrate as a standard system service.

    This mode is still experimental and will evolve over time. The
    command-line argument of ``-j`` toggles Zeek to run in "Supervisor
    mode" to allow for creation and management of child processes. If
    you're going to test this, please note that you will need some
    custom script code to configure the processes you want Zeek to
    run. See the documentation for more information:
    https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/frameworks/supervisor.html

    Unlike /dev/urandom, getrandom() doesn't need a file descriptor and

  * Increase a timeout for a btest (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.350 | 2020-01-06 10:51:07 -0800

  * Fix Cirrus CI FreeBSD python dependencies installation (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.348 | 2020-01-06 11:19:36 -0700

  * Increase timeout for a btest

    May be more timing-sensitive with slower ASAN/LSAN configuration in
    addition to already-slower CI environment. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Switch CI scripts to use ASAN/LSAN instead of gperftools

    Using AddressSanitizer/LeakSanitizer is better.  It covers the full
    unit/baseline test suite by default without requiring one to write
    specific memory leak tests.  It also covers other types of memory errors
    besides just leaks. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove redundant memory leak btests

    Or otherwise convert into a regular btest if it didn't already seem to
    be covered.

    There's no need for a separate memory leak test group since compiling
    with LeakSanitizer now covers leak checking for the full btest suite. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix reference counting issues related to lambdas/closures

    For example, circular references between a lambda function the frame
    it's stored within and/or its closure could cause memory leaks.

    This also fixes other various reference-count ownership issues that
    could lead to memory errors.

    There may still be some potential/undiscovered issues because the "outer
    ID" finding logic doesn't look quite right as the AST traversal descends
    within nested lambdas and considers their locals as "outer", but
    possibly the other logic for locating values in closures or cloning
    closures just works around that behavior. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Disable LeakSanitizer for btests that have known leaks

    E.g. ones that throw interpreter exceptions,  as those are currently
    known to potentially cause leaks.  Fixing the underlying leaks involves
    the larger task of more IntrusivePtr usage.

    Reference cycles may also cause leaks. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Rewrite the btest for when-statement timeouts

    To avoid a memory leak in DNS lookups that's hard to work around and
    does not otherwise effect typical operation when Zeek is allowed to
    continue to run after zeek_init(). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leak when a logging plugin hook prevents a write (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leaks in various input framework error-handling cases (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leak in Reporter::get_weird_sampling_whitelist() BIF (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix reference counting of Log::Filter "config" field

    Which can potentially be a minor memory leak if there's a lot of dynamic
    adding/removing of logging filters. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leak in system_env() BIF (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Clean up triggers awaiting global state modification at shutdown

    Otherwise they can be reported as memory leaks since no more global
    state modifications will take place to notify the trigger to clean
    itself up. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leak in initializing log writers with no local backend (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix packet filter memory leaks (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Skip sending thread heartbeat if it alread asked to be finished

    Otherwise the heartbeat message may fail to be processed and show up as
    leaked memory. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leak of sqlite input reader prepared statement (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Prevent duplicate "finish" threading messages

    As they don't get processed and may show up as a memory leak. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leak when table-based input stream overwrites old entries (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix scripting error in a DHCP btest (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leaks in Kerberos ticket decryption

    Memory allocated to the decrypted ticket data as well as the server
    principal were not freed.

    Also fixed potential leaks in error cases that called
    krb5_get_error_message() without freeing the returned value. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix scripting error in an ftp btest (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update paraglob submodule (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix malloc/delete mismatch in JSON formatting

    ODesc allocated with malloc() and BroString deallocated with delete[],
    but really the intermediate BroString wasn't even needed when copying
    into std::string. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Delete/timeout pending DNS requests during shutdown

    Primarily, this change prevents the pending requests showing up as
    memory leaks. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix memory leak in OCSP parsing functions

    Various OCSP parsing functions used in presence of OpenSSL 1.1 used
    "d2i_ASN1_SEQUENCE_ANY" which returns a "STACK_OF(ASN1_TYPE)", but used
    "sk_ASN1_TYPE_free" instead of "sk_ASN1_TYPE_pop_free" to free it.  The
    former only frees the stack structure while the later frees both the
    structure and the elements. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Free the global X509 certificate root store on shutdown

    Otherwise LeakSanitizer reports its contents as leaked. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add general LeakSanitizer macros/instrumentation (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve --sanitizers configure option

    * Rename SANITIZERS CMake variable to ZEEK_SANITIZERS for clarity

    * Use -O1 by default to improve speed (set NO_OPTIMIZATIONS env. var.
      to override and use -O0).  Uses -fno-optimize-sibling-calls with -O1
      to still get "perfect stack traces".

    * Updates various sub-projects with sanitizer improvements:
      binpac and bifcl, by default, now ignore leaks reported by LeakSanitizer
      so that it doesn't interfere with the Zeek build (Jon Siwek, Corelight)


3.1.0-dev.319 | 2020-01-06 09:44:11 -0800

  * Mark safe_snprintf and safe_vsnprintf as deprecated, remove uses of them (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Add unit tests to util.cc and module_util.cc (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    Provides access to all zeek command-line arguments ("argv"). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.297 | 2019-12-05 11:57:12 -0700

  * GH-700: add packet_sources() BIF

    Provides access to properties of packet sources, like interface or pcap
    file name. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.295 | 2019-12-04 14:43:27 -0700

  * Use new Zeek Logo instead of Bro Eyes on README.md (Dev Bali, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.292 | 2019-12-02 13:37:19 -0800

  * GH-619: Allow "print" statements to be redirected to a Log (Dev Bali, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.286 | 2019-11-21 08:47:32 -0800

  * GH-684: Fix parsing of RPC calls with non-AUTH_UNIX flavors

    The parsing logic that should be specific to the AUTH_UNIX credential
    flavor was previously applied unconditionally to other flavors. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.284 | 2019-11-21 08:29:36 -0800

  * Fix ZEEK_PROFILER_FILE file format/parsing

    Some Zeek script statement descriptions were exceeding the hardcoded
    maximum length and also could contain tab characters which were
    supposed to be reserved for use as a delimiter in the file format. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.282 | 2019-11-18 12:06:13 +0000

  * GH-646: Add new "successful_connection_remove" event. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Includes:

        - Switch Zeek's base scripts over to using it in place of
          "connection_state_remove". The difference between the two is
          that "connection_state_remove" is raised for all events
          while "successful_connection_remove" excludes TCP
          connections that were never established (just SYN packets).
          There can be performance benefits to this change for some
          use-cases.

        - Add new event called ``connection_successful`` and a new
          ``connection`` record field named "successful" to help
          indicate this new property of connections.

3.1.0-dev.280 | 2019-11-15 18:27:27 -0800

  * Fix compile warnings on OpenBSD (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.271 | 2019-11-14 19:16:31 -0800

  * Add initial scaffold for unit testing via doctest (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.266 | 2019-11-14 17:29:00 -0800

  * Add hint to run `make distclean` if configure fails (Simon Hardy-Francis, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.264 | 2019-11-14 16:57:13 -0800

  * Install test-all-policy.zeek script (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The zeekygen script, which is already installed, refers to it, and
    could also generally be useful for "test everything" type scenarios.

3.1.0-dev.263 | 2019-11-13 13:43:16 -0800

  * Improve record_fields() BIF to recursively give full container type names (Henri DF)

3.1.0-dev.257 | 2019-11-11 13:40:11 -0800

  * Update embedded CAF to 0.17.3 (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.256 | 2019-11-07 13:42:11 -0800

  * Allow record_fields() string arguments that name a record type (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.253 | 2019-11-05 09:54:01 -0800

  * Add and use new IntrusivePtr type (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

    Manual memory management via Ref/Unref is verbose and prone to error. An
    intrusive smart pointer automates the reference counting, makes code
    more robust (in particular w.r.t. to exceptions) and reduces boilerplate
    code. A big benefit of the intrusive smart pointers for Zeek is that
    they can co-exist with the manual memory management. Rather than having
    to port the entire code base at once, we can migrate components
    one-by-one. In this first step, we add the new template
    `IntrusivePtr<T>` and start using it in the Broker Manager. This makes
    the previous `unref_guard` obsolete.

3.1.0-dev.247 | 2019-11-04 17:26:32 -0800

  * Cluster-ize FTP data channel analysis (Jeff Barber)

    The ftp_data_expected table is now synchronized across Zeek
    worker nodes.  Note there's still a possible race condition where
    the traffic for the ftp-data connection proceeds before the Zeek
    cluster has a change to inform workers to expect it.

3.1.0-dev.245 | 2019-11-04 16:57:11 -0800

  * Use CMake object libraries for subdir libs and plugins (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.241 | 2019-11-04 09:44:20 -0800

  * Revert recent changes to Base64.h API. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This reverts commit 705210a035d4128ecdf249c7db98607c570bfcd2.
    The original changes broke the Base64.h API which may be used by
    external plugins.

3.1.0-dev.240 | 2019-11-01 15:58:55 -0700

  * Use #pragma once in Base64.h (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.229 | 2019-10-30 07:57:19 +0000

  * GH-664: fix signature matching for cases where the first TCP
    packet seen contained payload data, regardless of its TCP flags.
    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.227 | 2019-10-29 09:39:10 -0700

  * Replace build_unique with make_unique (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This was a rarely used convenience function from when we did not yet
    have c++17 support.

  * GH-626: Revert "Fix compilation on OS-X." (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    Reverts workaround in cde28074a169212aa8f38fdac225ecbeac4e642d
    which depended on C++14 features at a time when we used only C++11.

3.1.0-dev.222 | 2019-10-28 20:18:15 -0700

  * Install cmake3 from EPEL on CentOS CI system (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.221 | 2019-10-28 18:30:24 -0700

  * Require CMake 3.0+ (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

  * Move CMake project() after cmake_minimum_required() (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

    The call to `project` must come after `cmake_minimum_required` in CMake
    in order to get the correct policy settings.

3.1.0-dev.219 | 2019-10-28 20:59:12 +0100

  * GH-654: allow table() in function &default expressions

    Table parameters of functions previously did not coerce unspecified
    tables used in their &default attribute to the correct type. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-654: allow table() in record &default expressions

    Table fields of records previously did not coerce unspecified tables
    used in their &default attribute to the correct type. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix up some documentation. (Keith J. Jones)

3.1.0-dev.214 | 2019-10-28 10:58:43 +0000

  * Change usage of old bro:see directive to zeek:see (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Use explicit path name for NTP log stream (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    For consistency (we do this for all other logs) and just to avoid
    the extra path function calls.

3.1.0-dev.201 | 2019-10-25 10:12:49 -0700

  * Fixed typo. (Keith J. Jones)

   * Zeekctl: change gzip compression level from 9 to default #614 (JC Connell)

3.1.0-dev.191 | 2019-10-16 10:02:45 -0700

  * Update broker submodule to use pybind11 v2.4.3 (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve &default validation for global vars: exclude sets (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove unnecessary &optional from a Config::set_value() parameter (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove check for redundant attributes (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.185 | 2019-10-15 16:46:22 -0700

  * Add weirds for invalid TCP option lengths (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-618: add "tcp_options" event containing TCP option values (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix tcp_option event

    It was not being raised in all the cases it should have been due to
    an incorrect/unnecessary truncation check. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.181 | 2019-10-14 22:05:01 -0700

3.1.0-dev.175 | 2019-10-12 10:39:49 -0700

  * Use Ubuntu 14.04 for Travis CI environment (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.172 | 2019-10-08 15:14:35 -0700

  * Add new BIF: print_raw()

    This is a convenience function to make it easier to print literal byte
    sequences to stdout without additional escaping like what may be added
    by the default `print` statement behavior.

    For example, related to GH-596, `print` currently escapes even valid
    UTF-8 byte sequences and makes it difficult to output valid JSON strings
    containing such. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix compilation on OS-X. (Johanna Amann)

3.1.0-dev.169 | 2019-10-07 10:50:35 -0700

  * Update COPYING.3rdparty (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Use json::emplace to avoid some extra calls to operator[] (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Use tessil/unordered-map instead of nlohmann/fifo-map to improve JSON
    logging performance (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.156 | 2019-10-01 09:05:49 +0000

  * Improve RecordVal JSON formatting to no longer create a record
    introspection table each time when all the required information
    can be obtained directly in the RecordVal and RecordType objects.
    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.153 | 2019-09-30 21:09:55 -0700

  * Fix Xcode deprecation warning for std::ptr_fun (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.143 | 2019-09-24 10:23:24 -0700

  * Simplify reassembly code using DataBlockList::LastBlock() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix DataBlockList::DataSize() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Parameters got filled opposite to what they were supposed to be and
    also didn't consider cutoffs that land in the middle of a block.

3.1.0-dev.141 | 2019-09-24 10:31:50 +0000

  * Reorganize reassembly data structures. This replaces the previous
    linked list-based implementation with std::map to avoid O(n) worst
    case performance. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.131 | 2019-09-23 13:07:09 -0700

  * Add --build-dir as alias for --builddir (Dominik Charousset, Corelight)

  * Update header include guard in zeek-config.h/bro-config.h (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.124 | 2019-09-17 11:16:47 -0700

  * Add speculative service script. (Jan Grashoefer)

    The speculative service script handles dpd_late_match events to extend
    conn.log with infos about potential protocol identifications.

  * Allow to handle late DPD matches. (Jan Grashoefer)

    If "dpd_match_only_beginning" is disabled, matches of protocol signatures
    can be handeld using protocol_late_match. To prevent further matching in
    this case, the new option "dpd_late_match_stop" may be activated.

3.1.0-dev.118 | 2019-09-17 17:21:58 +0000

  * GH-566: Fix cases where ssh_encrypted_packet event wasn't raised.
    When encrypted data was bundled within the same segment as the
    NewKeys message, it wasn't not reported via a
    ssh_encrypted_package event as it should have been. (Jon Siwek,
    Corelight)

3.1.0-dev.116 | 2019-09-17 10:08:38 -0700

  * GH-545: add "addl" parameter to flow_weird and net_weird events (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-554: don't init PIA endpoint matchers if there's only file-magic

    The logic for initializing PIA endpoint matchers was previously
    skipped if "there's no global rule matcher", and that's only true
    when no signature files get loaded.

    But when using `zeek -b`, some file-magic signatures still get loaded
    by default, so the PIA endpoint matchers still get initialized even
    though they don't need to be -- file-magic patterns play no part
    in PIA.

    For typical use-cases (not using the `-b` flag), this change won't
    help any, but we do at least use `-b` often within the test suite. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-554: remove use of file magic in protocol-based signature logic

    This can be a significant performance/memory improvement since
    otherwise the protocol-based rule matching logic ends up superfluously
    creating file-matching state per file-matcher per connection/endpoint. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-541: add test cases for NTLM AV Pair sequence handling (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-541: fix handling of NTLM AV Pair sequences

    Empty AV Pair sequences or AV Pair sequences that lack a terminator
    could cause accesses past the end of the parsed vector. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Make Tag::Error values constant (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Simplify operator bool()'s used for Tag error checks (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add/use unspecified IPAddr constants

    The analyzer-scheduling code was otherwise frequently converting the

  * Improve GitHub language identification/stats (Seth Hall, Corelight)

  * Zeekify thread naming. (Seth Hall, Corelight)

    I copied the same style that caf uses ("zk" with single dot and no space).
    This gives some consistency with caf and avoids us wasting more
    space beyond "bro: ".  OSs only give 16 characters for thread names
    so anything we can gain here is nice.

3.1.0-dev.58 | 2019-08-16 18:45:39 +0000

  * GH-532: Improve disable_analyzer BIF. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    - Add an extra "prevent" parameter (default value of false), which
      helps prevent the same analyzer type from being attached in the
      future.

    - Fixes disable_analyzer() to work when called even earlier, like
      within the protocol_confirmation event.

    - Fixes disable_analyzer() when called on an analyzer added to the
      tree via TCP_Analyzer::AddChildPacketAnalyzer.

  * Add new LogAscii::gzip_file_extension option. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    This can be used with the LogAscii::gzip_level option to set the file
    extension of log files when they are compressed at creation time.

3.1.0-dev.28 | 2019-08-13 12:01:44 -0700

  * Remove redundant buffering in ContentLine analyzer (Justin Azoff)

    The contentline analyzer has two code paths that buffer data:
     * right at the top of DeliverStream
     * later in DoDeliverOnce

    However, contentline can be in plain delivery mode, and if so, the
    buffer resize in DeliverStream does not need to be done just because
    DeliverStream was passed an 8K data chunk.

    This was causing contentline to resize it's buffer to fit chunks of HTTP
    response data.  Additionally, the buffer was sized to be 3/2 of the
    chunk, so an 8K chunk would result in a 12K allocation.

3.1.0-dev.26 | 2019-08-13 11:25:20 -0700

  * Add tests for {http,mime}_all_headers events (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    And remove unnecessary check for mime_all_headers in HTTP entities
    (they ony raise the http_all_headers event, never mime_all_headers).

3.1.0-dev.24 | 2019-08-12 19:30:26 -0700

  * Avoid buffering all http/mime headers (Justin Azoff)

    Only buffer all http/mime headers if the http_all_headers or
    mime_all_headers events are in use.

  * GH-527: fix parsing of MQTT Remaining Length field

    Packet length is encoded in up to four bytes, with MSB (0x80)
    indicating if there's more bytes in the representation still to follow.
    The comparison/bitwise-mask wasn't correctly testing the MSB.

  * Fix documentation warnings for MQTT identifiers (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-756 | 2019-08-05 17:32:33 -0700

  * Disable MQTT by default (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    To enable MQTT, one has to load policy/scripts/mqtt. Like with smb in
    2.5, the consts are loaded by default.

2.6-754 | 2019-08-05 10:12:51 -0700

  * GH-474: add MQTT::max_payload_size option

    This caps size of payload strings within mqtt_publish events and
    mqtt_publish.log files.  A new "payload_len" field in the log file
    shows the real payload size in cases where it may have been truncated. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-474: use topic vectors for MQTT (un)subscribe events/logs (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update Certificate Transparency list (Johanna Amann)

2.6-747 | 2019-08-02 11:30:52 -0700

  * Fix how Broker/CAF sleep duration options are set (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add duration thresholding to the conn-size analyzer. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    Now, in addition to setting thresholds for bytes and packet, one can set
    a threshold for connection duration. Note that the threshold event is
    only raised once the next packet in the connection is seen.

    This also fixes a small pre-existing bug, in which a bunch of warnings
    were raised if someone just used the lower-level functions without going
    through the higher-level scripting API.

2.6-744 | 2019-08-01 13:33:12 -0700

  * Guarantee unique internal name for each lambda function
    By dealing with hash collisions. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Use consistent hashing method for internal lambda function names

    The results of std::hash<std::string> may vary depending on platform.
    E.g. test suite failed on macOS due to Linux generating different lambda
    function names. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve error messages from to_addr and to_subnet BIFs. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-739 | 2019-08-01 12:28:25 -0700

  * Fix the link to "good first issue" tickets. (Seth Hall, Corelight)

2.6-733 | 2019-07-31 21:23:37 -0700

  * Add MQTT analyzer, updated/ported from original version by Supriya Kumar (Seth Hall, Corelight)

    This analyzer generates three logs to fully display what is happening over the MQTT connection.
      - mqtt_connect.log
      - mqtt_subscribe.log
      - mqtt_publish.log

    At this time it only supports MQTT 3.1 and 3.1.1

2.6-708 | 2019-07-30 02:46:39 +0000

  * Add an additional license file, COPYING.3rdparty, that collects
    all third party software licenses. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

2.6-706 | 2019-07-30 02:30:44 +0000

  * Zeek's anonymous functions now capture their closures by
    reference. This means that they can use and modify variables from
    the scope that they were generated in. For example:

        local n = 3;
        local f = function() { n += 1; };
        f();
        print n; # prints 4

    See NEWS and the documentations for more details. (Zeke Medley, Corelight)

  * Add release branches to Travis CI whitelist (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-488: teach the Version module to parse new version scheme

    Such as the new -rc format for release candidates (replacing "beta") and
    -dev.X for development versions in the master branch. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve type inference for vector-of-enum constructor (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GHI-486: Switch over to using LLVM utf8-checking code to better validate characters (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Fix undefined behavior via casting file analyzers to protocol analyzers

    When generating some events for PE and X509 file analyzers, there's
    an invalid cast from file_analysis::Analyzer to analyzer::Analyzer
    and subsequent invalid member access via analyzer::Analyzer::GetID()
    called on what is really a pointer to a file analyzer. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix undefined behavior via hrw_weight BIF signed int overflow (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix undefined behavior via invalid TCP analyzer cast

    A connection's root analyzer isn't necessarily TCP and an unchecked
    C-style cast is undefined behavior in those cases. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-485: fix cases where DHCP log omits MAC field

    The field is populated in this order of preference:

      (1) Use a client-identifier option sent by client
      (2) Use the server's CHADDR field
      (3) Use the client's CHADDR field

    Case (3) did not exist before this patch. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-649 | 2019-07-23 09:37:05 -0700

  * Mark List::sort as deprecated, remove List::sortedinsert (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Simplify container iterators to just use pointers directly (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

2.6-635 | 2019-07-22 10:58:56 -0700

  * Add DPD::max_violations option

    This allows one to tune the number of protocol violations to tolerate
    from any given analyzer type before just disabling a given instance
    of it.

    Also removes the "disabled_aids" field from the DPD::Info record
    since it serves no purpose: in this case, calling disable_analyzer
    multiple times for the same analyzer is a no-op. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Abort when --enable-jemalloc is given, but JeMalloc is not found
    (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * GH-475: Require --enable-perftools to link in tcmalloc. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-591 | 2019-07-11 13:29:28 -0700

  * Fix potential thread safety issue with zeekenv util function

    Observed segfault accessing the local static std::map of zeekenv() from
    a logging thread, but only in non-debug builds using Apple/Clang
    compiler, not in a debug build or GCC.  Don't quite get this behavior
    since static local variable initialization is supposed to be thread-safe
    since C++11, but moving to a global static works and is "more efficient"
    anyway since there's no longer any run-time overhead. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix CIF integration and add logging options to intel.log and added comments to code (sfinlon)

2.6-558 | 2019-07-01 01:27:50 -0700

  * GH-443: fix uses of timestamp 0 in cluster diagnostic logs

    For broker.log and cluster.log: there was a race condition.  A worker's
    first IOSource that it processes is potentially Broker if there were
    no packets available yet and thread scheduling happens to work out
    such that network connections (inside CAF threads) become established
    before we enter the main I/O loop.  Such peering establishments would
    generate logs with timestamp 0 as there was not yet any code path
    taken that would update network_time.

    For reporter.log: any non-worker (packet-processing) node would just
    unnecessarily use a timestamp of 0 for their reporter messages. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-556 | 2019-07-01 00:56:13 -0700

  * Improve deprecation warning messages (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove deprecated print_hook event (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove dead code: dump_used_event_handlers (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove unused software_version_found events

    - software_version_found
    - software_unparsed_version_found
    - software_parse_error (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove deprecated open_log_file and log_file_name functions (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove deprecated/unused "packet" type (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Un-deprecate anonymizer BIFs (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Un-deprecate file rotation functions

    - rotate_file
    - rotate_file_by_name
    - calc_next_rotate

    These still have use-cases even though no longer used for our logging
    functionality.  E.g. rotate_file_by_name may be used to rotate
    pcap dump files.

    Also the log_rotate_base_time option was marked deprecated, but still
    used in the new logging framework. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Switch default CAF scheduler policy to work sharing

    It may generally be better for our default use-case, as workers may
    save a few percent cpu utilization as this policy does not have to
    use any polling like the stealing policy does.

    This also helps avoid a potential issue with the implementation of
    spinlocks used in the work-stealing policy in current CAF versions,
    where there's some conditions where lock contention causes a thread
    to spin for long periods without relinquishing the cpu to others. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update sqlite to 3.28.0.  (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * GH-320: Improve RFB (VNC) protocol parsing

    Parsing now stops for both client and server if either encounters
    any parsing error or invalid state.

    After a complete handshake, server messages are no longer parsed.
    Support for that is incomplete and not sure it's that useful anyway
    since it mostly contains pixel data. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add Windows Minidump file signature (Alexander Bolshakov)

2.6-534 | 2019-06-28 11:48:41 -0700

  * Change notices to be processed on worker. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    In the past they were processed on the manager - which requires big
    records to be sent around.

    This has a potential of incompatibilities if someone relied on global
    state for notice processing.

    Also may prevent notice de-duplication due to expected race
    condition of suppression messages taking time to proaogate out
    to all cluster nodes.

2.6-529 | 2019-06-27 10:12:34 -0700

  * Fix creating a StringVal from std::string. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    Currently, creating a StringVal from a std::string did not work with
    data that contains \0 characters. This easy fix changes this - and
    should also lead to a small speed increase for code using this
    constructor.

    This obviously means that more data might copied now in some cases that
    were previously cut off at the first 0-byte. Our test-suite did not
    reveal any such cases.

2.6-526 | 2019-06-25 12:45:31 -0700

2.6-523 | 2019-06-25 10:38:24 -0700

  * GH-427: improve default ID values shown by Zeekygen

    The default value of an ID is now truly the one used to initialize it,
    unaltered by any subsequent redefs.

    Redefs are now shown separately, along with the expression that
    modifies the ID's value. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Renaming src/StateAccess.{h,cc} to src/Notifier.{h,cc}.

    The old names did not reflect the content of the files anymore. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Remove MutableVal, StateAccess classes, enum Opcode. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Redo API for notifiers.

    There's now an notifier::Modifiable interface class that class
    supposed to signal modifications are to be derived from. This takes
    the place of the former MutableValue class and also unifies how Val
    and IDs signal modifications. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Redo NotfifierRegistry to no longer rely on StateAccess.

    We simplify the API to a simple Modified() operation. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Add new test for when-statement watching global variables. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

  * Remove unused SerialInfo.h and SerialTypes.h headers (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-476 | 2019-06-20 13:23:22 -0700

  * Remove opaque of ocsp_resp. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    Only used in one event, without any way to use the opaque for anything
    else. At this point this just seems like a complication that has no
    reason to be there.

  * Remove remnants of event serializer. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Reimplement serialization infrastructure for OpaqueVals.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight & Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    We need this to sender through Broker, and we also leverage it for
    cloning opaques. The serialization methods now produce Broker data
    instances directly, and no longer go through the binary formatter.

    Summary of the new API for types derived from OpaqueVal:

        - Add DECLARE_OPAQUE_VALUE(<class>) to the class declaration
        - Add IMPLEMENT_OPAQUE_VALUE(<class>) to the class' implementation file
        - Implement these two methods (which are declated by the 1st macro):
            - broker::data DoSerialize() const
            - bool DoUnserialize(const broker::data& data)

    This machinery should work correctly from dynamic plugins as well.

    OpaqueVal provides a default implementation of DoClone() as well that
    goes through serialization. Derived classes can provide a more
    efficient version if they want.

    The declaration of the "OpaqueVal" class has moved into the header
    file "OpaqueVal.h", along with the new serialization infrastructure.
    This is breaking existing code that relies on the location, but
    because the API is changing anyways that seems fine.

  * Implement a Shallow Clone operation for types. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This is needed to track name changes for the documentation.

    v[2:4] = vector(6, 7, 8);        # v is now [1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 5]
    print v[:4];                     # prints [1, 2, 6, 7]

    The old functions still exist for now, but are deprecated.

2.6-376 | 2019-06-05 13:29:57 -0700

  * GH-379: move catch-and-release and unified2 scripts to policy/ (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    These are no longer loaded by default due to the performance impact they
    cause simply by being loaded (they have event handlers for commonly
    generated events) and they aren't generally useful enough to justify it.

2.6-375 | 2019-06-04 19:28:06 -0700

  * Simplify threading::Value destructor (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-159: Allow coercion of numeric record field values to other types (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Allow passing a location to BroObj::Warning and BroObj::Error. (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    This allows callers (such as check_and_promote) to pass an expression
    location to be logged if the location doesn't exist in the value being
    promoted.

  * Add CLion directories to gitignore (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Move #define outside of max_type for clarity (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

2.6-361 | 2019-06-04 10:30:21 -0700

  * GH-293: Protect copy() against reference cycles. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    Reference cycles shouldn't occur but there's nothing really preventing
    people from creating them, so may just as well be safe and deal with
    them when cloning values.

2.6-359 | 2019-05-31 13:37:17 -0700

  * Remove old documentation reference to rotate_interval (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-357 | 2019-05-30 10:57:54 -0700

  * Tweak to ASCII reader warning suppression (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    Warnings in the ASCII reader so far remained suppressed even
    when an input file changed. It's helpful to learn about problems
    in the data when putting in place new data files, so this change
    maintains the existing warning suppression while processing a file,
    but re-enables warnings after updates to a file.

2.6-354 | 2019-05-29 09:46:19 -0700

  * Add weird: "RDP_channels_requested_exceeds_max" (Vlad Grigorescu)

  * Reduce data copying in Broker message processing (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve Broker I/O loop integration: less mutex locking (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Checking a subscriber for available messages required locking a mutex,
    but we should never actually need to do that in the main-loop to check
    for Broker readiness since we can rely on file descriptor polling.

  * Improve processing of broker data store responses (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Now retrieves and processes all N available responses at once instead
    of one-by-one-until-empty.

2.6-345 | 2019-05-28 11:32:16 -0700

2.6-334 | 2019-05-23 20:40:03 -0700

  * Add an internal getenv wrapper function: zeekenv (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    It maps newer environment variable names starting with ZEEK to the
    legacy names starting with BRO.

  * Rename all BRO-prefixed environment variables (Daniel Thayer)

    For backward compatibility when reading values, we first check
    the ZEEK-prefixed value, and if not set, then check the corresponding
    BRO-prefixed value.

2.6-331 | 2019-05-23 18:03:42 -0700

  * Update broker unit test output. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix parse-time RecordVal tracking containing duplicates (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-325 | 2019-05-22 23:56:23 -0700

  * Add leak-checks for new copy operations (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

  * Finish implementation of new copy method. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    All types (besides EntropyVal) now support a native copy operation,
    which uses primitives of the underlying datatypes to perform a quick
    copy, without serialization.

    EntropyVal is the one exception - since that type is rather complex
    (many members) and will probably not be copied a lot, if at all, it
    makes sense to just use the serialization function.

    This will have to be slightly re-written in the near-term-future to use
    the new serialization function for that opaque type.

    This change also introduces a new x509_from_der bif, which allows to
    parse a der into an opaque of x509.

    This change removes the d2i_X509_ wrapper function; this was a remnant
    when d2i_X509 took non-const arguments. We directly use d2i_X509 at
    several places assuming const-ness, so there does not seem to ba a
    reason to keep the wrapper.

    This change also exposed a problem in the File cache - cases in which an
    object was brought back into the cache, and writing occurred in the
    file_open event were never correctly handeled as far as I can tell.

  * Reimplement copy(). (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    The old implementation used the serialization framework, which is
    going away. This is a new standalone implementation that should also
    be quite a bit faster.

2.6-314 | 2019-05-20 16:20:33 -0700

  * Remove deprecated attributes. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)
    To be more exact: &encrypt, &mergeable, &rotate_interval, &rotate_size

    Also removes no longer used redef-able constants:
    log_rotate_interval, log_max_size, log_encryption_key

2.6-311 | 2019-05-20 09:07:58 -0700

  * Rename broctl submodule to zeekctl (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-286 | 2019-05-14 13:19:12 -0700

  * Undo an unintentional change to btest.cfg from a recent commit (Daniel Thayer)

  * GH-239: Rename bro to zeek, bro-config to zeek-config, and bro-path-dev to zeek-path-dev.
    (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

    This also installs symlinks from "zeek" and "bro-config" to a wrapper
    script that prints a deprecation warning.

  * GH-365: improve un-indexable type error message (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-277 | 2019-05-08 12:42:18 -0700

  * Allow tuning Broker log batching via scripts (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Via redefining "Broker::log_batch_size" or "Broker::log_batch_interval"

2.6-276 | 2019-05-08 09:03:27 -0700

  * Force the Broker IOSource to idle periodically, preventing packet
	  IOSource starvation. (Jon Siwek, Corelight).

  * GH-353: Add `/<re>/i` case-insensitive signature syntax (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-272 | 2019-05-06 18:43:13 -0700

  * Remove support for using && and || with patterns. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    This was never documented and previously deprecated.

  * Remove RemoteSerializer and related code/types. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

    Also removes broccoli from the source tree.

  * Remove PersistenceSerializer. (Johanna Amann, Corelight)

2.6-264 | 2019-05-03 11:16:38 -0700

  * Fix sporadic openflow/broker test failure (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-263 | 2019-05-02 22:49:40 -0700

  * Install local.zeek as symlink to pre-existing local.bro (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    This a convenience for those that are upgrading.  If we didn't do
    this, then deployments can silently break until the user intervenes
    since BroControl now prefers to load the initially-vanilla local.zeek
    instead of the formerly-customized local.bro.

2.6-262 | 2019-05-02 21:39:01 -0700

  * Rename Zeexygen to Zeekygen (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-258 | 2019-05-02 12:26:54 -0700

  * GH-340: Improve IPv4/IPv6 regexes, extraction, and validity functions.

    is_valid_ip() is not a BIF, the IP regular expressions are improved and
    extract_ip_addresses should give better results due to this.
    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-255 | 2019-05-01 08:38:49 -0700

  * Add methods to queue events without handler existence check

    Added ConnectionEventFast() and QueueEventFast() methods to avoid
    redundant event handler existence checks.

    It's common practice for caller to already check for event handler
    existence before doing all the work of constructing the arguments, so
    it's desirable to not have to check for existence again.

    E.g. going through ConnectionEvent() means 3 existence checks:
    one you do yourself before calling it, one in ConnectionEvent(), and then
    another in QueueEvent().

    The existence check itself can be more than a few operations sometimes
    as it needs to check a few flags that determine if it's enabled, has
    a local body, or has any remote receivers in the old comm. system or
    has been flagged as something to publish in the new comm. system. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Cleanup/improve PList usage and Event API

    Majority of PLists are now created as automatic/stack objects,
    rather than on heap and initialized either with the known-capacity
    reserved upfront or directly from an initializer_list (so there's no
    wasted slack in the memory that gets allocated for lists containing
    a fixed/known number of elements).

    Added versions of the ConnectionEvent/QueueEvent methods that take
    a val_list by value.

    Added a move ctor/assign-operator to Plists to allow passing them
    around without having to copy the underlying array of pointers. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-250 | 2019-04-29 18:09:29 -0700

  * Remove 'dns_resolver' option, replace w/ ZEEK_DNS_RESOLVER env. var. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-243 | 2019-04-22 19:42:52 -0700

  * GH-234: rename Broxygen to Zeexygen along with roles/directives (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    * All "Broxygen" usages have been replaced in
      code, documentation, filenames, etc.

    * Sphinx roles/directives like ":bro:see" are now ":zeek:see"

    * The "--broxygen" command-line option is now "--zeexygen"

2.6-242 | 2019-04-22 22:43:09 +0200

  * update SSL consts from TLS 1.3 (Johanna Amann)

2.6-241 | 2019-04-22 12:38:06 -0700

  * Add 'g' character to conn.log history field to flag content gaps (Vern Paxson, Corelight)

    There's also a small change to TCP state machine that distrusts ACKs
    appearing at the end of connections (in FIN or RST) such that they won't
    count towards revealing a true content gap.

2.6-237 | 2019-04-19 12:00:37 -0700

  * GH-236: Add zeek_script_loaded event, deprecate bro_script_loaded (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Existing handlers for bro_script_loaded automatically alias to the new
    zeek_script_loaded event, but emit a deprecation warning.

2.6-236 | 2019-04-19 11:16:35 -0700

  * Add zeek_init/zeek_done events and deprecate bro_init/bro_done (Seth Hall, Corelight)

    Any existing handlers for bro_init and bro_done will automatically alias
    to the new zeek_init and zeek_done events such that code will not break,
    but will emit a deprecation warning.

2.6-232 | 2019-04-18 09:34:13 +0200

  * GH-237: add `@load foo.bro` -> foo.zeek fallback (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    When failing to locate a script with explicit .bro suffix, check for
    whether one with a .zeek suffix exists and use it instead.

2.6-225 | 2019-04-16 16:07:49 -0700

  * Use .zeek file suffix in unit tests (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add test cases to verify new file extension is recognized (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix the core/load-duplicates.bro test (Daniel Thayer)

  * Update script search logic for new .zeek file extension (Daniel Thayer)

    When searching for script files, look for both the new and old file
    extensions.  If a file with ".zeek" can't be found, then search for
    a file with ".bro" as a fallback.

  * Remove unnecessary ".bro" from @load directives (Daniel Thayer)

2.6-212 | 2019-04-12 10:12:31 -0700

    - Adds tuning options: SSL::dtls_max_version_errors and
      SSL::dtls_max_reported_version_errors

2.6-200 | 2019-04-03 09:44:53 -0700

  * Fix reporter net_weird API usage for unknown_mobility_type
    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove variable content from weird names

    This changes many weird names to move non-static content from the
    weird name into the "addl" field to help ensure the total number of
    weird names is reasonably bounded.  Note the net_weird and flow_weird
    events do not have an "addl" parameter, so information may no longer
    be available in those cases -- to make it available again we'd need
    to either (1) define new events that contain such a parameter, or
    (2) change net_weird/flow_weird event signature (which is a breaking
    change for user-code at the moment).

    Also, the generic handling of binpac exceptions for analyzers which
    to not otherwise catch and handle them has been changed from a Weird
    to a ProtocolViolation.

    Finally, a new "file_weird" event has been added for reporting
    weirdness found during file analysis. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.6-197 | 2019-04-03 09:08:58 -0700

  * Make Syslog analyzer accept non-conformant messages that omit Priority.

2.6-157 | 2019-03-14 16:18:13 +0000

  * GH-250: Add VXLAN decapsulation support (Henrik Lund Kramshoej; Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Zeek now automatically decapsulates VXLAN traffic on UDP port
    4789. It will log such sessions as Tunnel::VXLAN in tunnel.log and
    proceed to analyze the inner payload. Two options allow to tune
    the analysis:

        * "Tunnel::vxlan_ports" allows to tune the set of VXLAN ports
          to analyze/decapsulate.

        * "Tunnel::validate_vxlan_checksums" allows for tuning of how
          checksums associated with the outer UDP header of a possible
          VXLAN tunnel are handled.

    A new "vxlan_packet" event also provides per-packet access to
    VXLAN traffic.

2.6-154 | 2019-03-13 17:28:26 -0700

  * Decrease memory usage via deferred list/dict initialization (Justin Azoff, Corelight)

2.6-149 | 2019-03-13 18:21:59 +0000

  * GH-289: Add options to limit entries in http.log file fields. The
    "orig_fuids", "orig_filenames", "orig_mime_types" http.log fields
    as well as their "resp" counterparts are now limited to having
    "HTTP::max_files_orig" or "HTTP::max_files_resp" entries, which
    are 15 by default.  The limit can also be ignored case-by-case via
    the "HTTP::max_files_policy" hook. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-282: Remove JSON formatter's range restriction on numbers. It
    now produces numbers as large as is required to match the data it
    needs to represent. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Corelight)

  * GH-286: Check for record type mismatch in ternary operator. (Jon

  * GH-208: change invalid subnet expressions to a runtime error (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * GH-211: improve consistency of how scripting errors are handled (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Scripting errors/mistakes now consistently generate a runtime error
    which have the behavior of unwinding the call stack all the way out of
    the current event handler.

    This also changes the behavior of the startup/initialization process
    to abort if there's errors during bro_init() rather than continue on
    to the main run loop.

2.6-113 | 2019-02-06 13:17:39 -0600

2.6-92 | 2019-01-22 08:53:36 -0800

  * GH-151: fix hash calculation for nested sets

    Hash key construction of nested sets depended on the order in
    which their elements are iterated, which varied even between sets
    containing equivalent elements.  The iteration order is now sorted
    by each element's hash value (or, on collision, by full key) such
    that equivalent sets no longer hash differently. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

       unknown.

     - Adds some new fields where the server is indicating information
       about itself (server_nb_computer_name, server_dns_computer_name,

  * Add compression methods to ssl_client_hello event. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-932 | 2018-08-30 00:08:58 +0000

  * Add Broker::forward() function. This enables explicit forwarding
    of events matching a given topic prefix.  Even if a receiving node
    has an event handler, it will not be raised if the event was sent
    along a topic that matches a previous call to Broker::forward().
    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Enable implicit Broker message forwarding by default. (Jon Siwek,
    Corelight)

  * Remove Cluster::broadcast_topic. As enabling Broker forwarding
    would cause routing loops with messages sent to such a topic (one
    subscribed to on all nodes). (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Remove Intel Broker topics, re-use existing Cluster topics. (Jon
    Siwek, Corelight)

  * Update broker docs to reflect best-practice/convention for
    declaring new topics.

  * Remove "relay" family of Broker functions.  (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Namely these are now removed:

        - Broker::relay
        - Broker::publish_and_relay
        - Cluster::relay_rr
        - Cluster::relay_hrw

    The idea being that Broker may eventually implement the necessary
    routing (plus load balancing) functionality.  For now, code that
    used these should "manually" handle and re-publish events as
    needed.

2.5-924 | 2018-08-29 18:21:37 -0500

  * Allow event/function headers to be wrapped in directives. (Johanna Amann)

    For example:

        @if ( conditions )
            event a(...)
        @else
            event b(...)
        @endif

  * Improve readability of the Travis job log (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix tracking of DCE-RPC context identifier mappings

    This adds previously-missing support for "Alter Context"
    request/response PDUs (initial patch contributed by Mark Fernandez).

    Also, context ID arguments were added to dce_rpc_bind, dce_rpc_request,
    and dce_rpc_response in order to properly track what endpoint/operation
    a given opnum maps to. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.5-897 | 2018-08-23 15:53:16 +0000

 * BIT-1885: Fix input framework memory leak. For input threads that
   get joined during run-time, messages could remain in the thread's
   queue and leak. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.5-894 | 2018-08-22 12:05:19 -0500

  * Fix SMTP command string comparisons (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Improve handling of empty lines in several text protocol analyzers
    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Add rate-limiting sampling mechanism for weird events

    The generation of weird events, by default, are now rate-limited
    according to these tunable options:

      - Weird::sampling_whitelist
      - Weird::sampling_threshold
      - Weird::sampling_rate
      - Weird::sampling_duration

    The new get_reporter_stats() BIF also allows one to query the
    total number of weirds generated (pre-sampling) which the new
    policy/misc/weird-stats.bro script uses periodically to populate
    a weird_stats.log.

    There's also new reporter BIFs to allow generating weirds from the
    script-layer such that they go through the same, internal
    rate-limiting/sampling mechanisms:

      - Reporter::conn_weird
      - Reporter::flow_weird
      - Reporter::net_weird

    Some of the code was adapted from previous work by Johanna Amann.
    (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

2.5-598 | 2018-05-22 15:05:24 -0500

  * Fixes for MySQL and SMB protocol parsers (Corelight)

    * MySQL: the parser for this was generally broken (not following
      the specification well) and needed many changes.  One addition is a
      new "mysql_result_row" event that provides access to the results of
      queries.

    * SMB: the spec seems to explitly call out the omission of the
      PrimaryDomain field on SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX responses (and I
      don't see that field in pcaps either), so this may have just been a
      typo that used to work fine in the past only due to faulty array
      parsing behavior in binpac.

  * BIT-1829: add unit test for modbus parser issue (Corelight)

2.5-591 | 2018-05-22 09:19:59 -0500

     * Reduced all DHCP events into a single dhcp_message event.
       (removed legacy events since they weren't widely used anyway)
     - Support many more DHCP options.

     - DHCP log is completely reworked and now represents DHCP sessions
       based on the transaction ID (and works on clusters).

     - Removed the known-devices-and-hostnames.bro and known-devices.bro
       scripts since it's generally less relevant now with the updated log.

  * Change include directory search order to better support --with-openssl.
    (Johanna Amann)

  * Add a .travis.yml. file (Daniel Thayer)

2.5-422 | 2018-02-05 16:28:25 -0600

  * fix setup field handling in smb1_com_transaction_request messages

    This field is an array of 16 bit words and was parsed as an array of
    32 bit words. Moreover, one can not assume the format is going to be a
    16 bits opcode followed by a 16 bit file ID, the content of the setup
    field is different according to its first 16 bits word that defines
    the subcommand code. See MS-CIFS section 2.2.4.33.1 :

    Setup (variable): An array of two-byte words that provides transaction
    context to the server. The size and content of the array are specific
    to individual subcommands. (Jeffrey Bencteux)

  * add smb1_transaction2_secondary_request event

    parse and expose SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2_SECONDARY (0x33) message to
    script level. See MS-CIFS section 2.2.4.47.1. (Jeffrey Bencteux)

  * add smb1_transaction_secondary_request event

    expose SMB_COM_TRANSACTION_SECONDARY (0x26) message to script
    language. See MS-CIFS section 2.2.4.34.1. (Jeffrey Bencteux)

  * add parameters and data to smb1_transaction_request/response messages

    expose SMB_Data.Trans_Parameters and SMB_Data.Trans_Data fields of
    SMB_COM_TRANSACTION (0x25) message type. See MS-CIFS section
    2.2.4.33.1.

    These fields are exposed to the script level as Bro strings. Note that
    this commit also expose a new event smb1_transaction_response.
    (Jeffrey Bencteux)

  * add SMB_Parameters.Words to smb1_transaction2_request event

    expose the fields contained in SMB_Parameters.Words of the
    SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2 (0x32) message to the script language. See
    MS-CIFS section 2.2.46.1. (Jeffrey Bencteux)

2.5-410 | 2018-02-05 15:18:41 -0600

  * Fix warnings when building sphinx docs (Corelight)

2.5-409 | 2018-02-05 14:12:21 -0600

  * Bug fix: nfs3_writeargs didn't properly return filehandle. (Devin Trejo)

  * Add NFS events and unit tests: nfs_proc_symlink, nfs_proc_link,
    nfs_proc_sattr. (Devin Trejo)

2.5-405 | 2018-02-05 13:29:39 -0600

  * Add MOUNT3 protocol parser.

    It's not activated by default.  New events available: mount_proc_null,
    mount_proc_mnt, mount_proc_umnt, mount_proc_umnt_all,
    mount_proc_not_implemented, mount_reply_status. (Devin Trejo)

2.5-402 | 2018-02-05 10:43:59 -0600

  * Fix (unlikely) memory leak in nb_dns.c (Corelight)

  * Remove bro-plugins submodule from .gitmodules file (Daniel Thayer)

2.5-399 | 2018-01-30 14:31:45 -0800

  * Adapt the X509 analyzer to partially support OpenSSL 1.1.
    (Hilgo Bengen, Johanna Amann)

2.5-395 | 2018-01-26 15:46:05 -0600

  * BIT-1894: fix bad integer casts in BIFs: sort, rand, order, to_int
    (Corelight)

2.5-392 | 2018-01-19 11:39:34 -0600

  * Make nearly all bool conversion operators explicit. (Corelight)

2.5-390 | 2018-01-17 16:09:55 -0600

  * Logging: implement get_filter_names and small fixes.

    get_filter_names(id: ID) : set[string] returns the names of the current
    list of filters for a specified log stream.

    Furthermore this commit makes a number of logging functions more robust
    by checking existence of values before trying to modify them. This
    commit also really implements (and tests) the enable_stream function.
    (Corelight)

2.5-388 | 2018-01-16 15:35:21 -0600

  * HTTP: Recognize and skip upgrade/websocket connections.

    This patches the HTTP analyzerto recognize when a connections is upgraded
    to a different protocol (e.g. client uses the Upgrade header and gets a
    101 reply).  In this case, the analyzer stops further processing (which
    would have resulted in DPD errors) and raises a new event:

      event http_connection_upgrade(c: connection, protocol: string);

    The protocol parameter contains the name of the protocol that is being
    upgraded to, as specified in one of the header values. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-385 | 2018-01-16 14:51:07 -0600

  * Make tunnel_parents in conn.log optional.

    This makes conn.logs a bit prettier (and smaller) because all lines tha
    do not use a tunnel will now have a "-" instead of the "(empty)" for
    tunnel_parents. (Johanna Amann)

  * Correct include-path in x509Common.h (Johanna Amann)

2.5-381 | 2018-01-12 10:03:21 -0800

  * Preallocate all possible PortVals, mark PortVal ctors deprecated.

    The performance benefit is small (maybe ~1% at most), however, it's a
    trivial change without downsides. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add BRO_DEPRECATED macro. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add functions for retrieving files by their id.

    There are two new script level functions to query and lookup files
    from the core by their IDs.  These are adding feature parity for
    similarly named functions for files.  The function prototypes are
    as follows:

      Files::file_exists(fuid: string): bool
      Files::lookup_File(fuid: string): fa_file (Seth Hall)

2.5-375 | 2018-01-11 11:47:01 -0600

  * Fix a test that fails in some environments (Daniel Thayer)

  * Add CVE ID for BIT-1856. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-372 | 2017-12-15 15:08:51 -0600

  * Remove some DNS weirds that caused volume and are generally not useful:
    dns_unmatched_msg, dns_unmatched_msg_quantity, dns_unmatched_reply.
    (Corelight)

2.5-369 | 2017-12-13 14:22:47 -0600

  * Fix typo in analyzer::Manager API docs (Corelight)

2.5-368 | 2017-12-08 13:09:25 -0600

  * Improve for-loop iteration performance over empty tables. (Justin Azoff)

  * Fix gcc7 warnings. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-363 | 2017-12-05 11:00:09 -0600

  * Fix documentation for ReassemblerStats. (Corelight)

2.5-362 | 2017-12-02 09:45:04 -0600

  * BIT-1791: Do not log SOCKS passwords by default and add
    SOCKS::default_capture_password option.  (Johanna Amann)

  * Add missing ; in SSL binpac parser, found by Luke Valenta. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-359 | 2017-11-29 14:01:37 -0600

  * Add --ccache option to configure script (requires CMake 3.10+). (Corelight)

2.5-358 | 2017-11-28 12:28:14 -0800

  * Extend the TLS analyzer with several events containing cryptographic
    parameters from the client and server key exchanges.

   The new events are:

    ssl_ecdh_server_params, ssl_dh_server_params, ssl_server_signature,
    ssl_ecdh_client_params, ssl_dh_client_params, ssl_rsa_client_pms

    Since ssl_ecdh_server_params contains more information than the old
    ssl_server_curve event, ssl_server_curve is now marked as deprecated.

    (Luke Valenta)

2.5-352 | 2017-11-21 13:21:51 -0600

  * Fix assignments to event arguments becoming visible to subsequent
    handlers. (Robin Sommer)

2.5-350 | 2017-11-21 12:19:28 -0600

  * Add HookReporter plugin hook function.

    This hook gives access to basically all information that is available in
    the function in Reporter.cc that performs the logging. The hook is
    called each time when anything passes through the reporter in the cases
    in which an event usually would be called. This includes weirds. The
    hook can return false to prevent the normal reporter events from being
    raised. (Corelight)

2.5-348 | 2017-11-21 11:30:55 -0600

  * Fix a nb_dns.c compile error (older OSs) due to C90 vs C99. (Corelight)

2.5-347 | 2017-11-20 14:00:37 -0600

  * Fix and extend behavior of HookLoadFile. (Corelight)

2.5-345 | 2017-11-20 11:28:59 -0600

  * BIT-1827: fix error on initializing DNS w/ IPv6 nameserver. (Corelight)

  * Add --build-type flag to configure wrapper. (Corelight)

2.5-343 | 2017-11-17 15:27:04 -0800

  * Fix ASCII logging of very large values of type "double".
    Previously, the nonsensical "NAN.0" would be written to ASCII logs
    for any value >= 1e248). (Daniel Thayer)

  * Add more test cases to ascii-double.bro (Daniel Thayer)

  * Enforce a maximum line length in ContentLine analyzer. (Justin Azoff)

  * Fix OOB read with IP packets that have a header length greater than the total
    length of their packet. (Johanna Amann)

  * Verify version field of IP packets read from tunnels. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-332 | 2017-10-27 13:27:16 -0700

  * Bro docs tweaks for correctness and readability. (Christian Kreibich)

  * Fix use-after-free in Trigger.cc. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-328 | 2017-10-16 13:13:41 -0700

  * Patch OOB write in content-line analyzer.

    A combination of packets can trigger an out of bound write of '0' byte
    in the content-line analyzer. Addresses BIT-1856 / CVE-2017-1000458.
    (Frank Meier/Johanna Amann)

2.5-327 | 2017-10-16 12:21:01 -0700

  * Updating submodule(s).

2.5-326 | 2017-10-05 14:34:20 -0700

  * Update the SSH analyzer to support the "curve25519-sha256" KEX.
    (Vlad Grigorescu)

2.5-321 | 2017-10-03 12:00:29 -0500

  * Add "-B scripts" flag to allow debug output of script load order.
    (Corelight)

  * Fix segmentation fault on eval condition with no return value. (Corelight)

2.5-317 | 2017-09-29 09:54:50 -0400

  * BIT-1853 - Fix an issue with broctl triggering reporter error in the
    intel framework. (Justin Azoff)

  * BIT-1845 - Make "in" keyword work with binary data. (Johanna Amann)

  * Add TLS 1.3 fix and testcase due to Google Chrome's use of TLS 1.3.

    It turns out that Chrome supports an experimental mode to support TLS
    1.3, which uses a non-standard way to negotiate TLS 1.3 with a server.
    This non-standard way to negotiate TLS 1.3 breaks the current draft RFC
    and re-uses an extension on the server-side with a different binary
    formatting, causing us to throw a binpac exception.

    This patch ignores the extension when sent by the server, continuing to
    correctly parse the server_hello reply (as far as possible).

    From what I can tell this seems to be google working around the fac
    that MITM equipment cannot deal with TLS 1.3 server hellos; this change
    makes the fact that TLS 1.3 is used completely opaque unless one looks
    into a few extensions.

    We currently log this as TLS 1.2. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-310 | 2017-09-21 09:10:21 -0700

  * fix interaction of gridftp scripts with other thresholds. (Justin Azoff)

2.5-307 | 2017-09-20 10:51:09 -0500

  * BIT-1846: Updating broctl submodule to include fix for symlinking
    issue (Jon Siwek)

2.5-306 | 2017-09-18 14:43:42 -0700

  * Make strerror_r portable, supporting XSI/gnu versions. (Thomas Petersen)

  * Prevent crash when calling bro -U. (Thomas Petersen)

  * Remove annoying error message from connsize bifs. (Johanna Amann)

  * Add test to verify that log rotation works with gzipped logs (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix ascii writer to not discard a ".gz" file extension. (Daniel Thayer)

    When Bro writes a compressed log, it uses a file extension of ".gz".
    However, upon log rotation the ascii writer script function
    "default_rotation_postprocessor_func" was discarding the ".gz"
    file extension.  Fixed so that the correct file extension is
    preserved after rotation. (Daniel Thayer)

2.5-297 | 2017-09-11 09:26:33 -0700

  * Fix small OCSP parser bug; serial numbers were not passed to events
    (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix expire-redef.bro test. (Daniel Thayer)

2.5-294 | 2017-08-11 13:51:49 -0500

  * Fix core.truncation unit test on macOS. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix a netcontrol test that often fails (Daniel Thayer)

  * Update install instructions for Fedora 26 (Daniel Thayer)

2.5-288 | 2017-08-04 14:17:10 -0700

  * Fix field not being populated, which resulted in a reporter
    messsage. Addresses BIT-1831. Reported by Chris Herdt. (Seth Hall)

  * Support for OCSP and Signed Certificate Timestamp. (Liang
    Zhu/Johanna Amann)

      - OCSP parsing is added to the X.509 module.

      - Signed Certificate Timestamp extraction, parsing, & validation
        is added to the SSL, X.509, and OCSP analyzers. Validation is
        added to the X.509 BIFs.

    This adds the following events and BIFs:

      - event ocsp_request(f: fa_file, version: count, requestorName: string);
      - event ocsp_request_certificate(f: fa_file, hashAlgorithm: string, issuerNameHash: string, issuerKeyHash: string, serialNumber: string);
      - event ocsp_response_status(f: fa_file, status: string);
      - event ocsp_response_bytes(f: fa_file, resp_ref: opaque of ocsp_resp, status: string, version: count, responderId: string, producedAt: time, signatureAlgorithm: string, certs: x509_opaque_vector);
      - event ocsp_response_certificate(f: fa_file, hashAlgorithm: string, issuerNameHash: string, issuerKeyHash: string, serialNumber: string, certStatus: string, revokeTime: time, revokeReason: string, thisUpdate: time, nextUpdate: time);
      - event ocsp_extension(f: fa_file, ext: X509::Extension, global_resp: bool);
      - event x509_ocsp_ext_signed_certificate_timestamp(f: fa_file, version: count, logid: string, timestamp: count, hash_algorithm: count, signature_algorithm: count, signature: string);
      - event ssl_extension_signed_certificate_timestamp(c: connection, is_orig: bool, version: count, logid: string, timestamp: count, signature_and_hashalgorithm: SSL::SignatureAndHashAlgorithm, signature: string);
      - function sct_verify(cert: opaque of x509, logid: string, log_key: string, signature: string, timestamp: count, hash_algorithm: count, issuer_key_hash: string &default=""): bool
      - function x509_subject_name_hash(cert: opaque of x509, hash_alg: count): string
      - function x509_issuer_name_hash(cert: opaque of x509, hash_alg: count): string
      - function x509_spki_hash(cert: opaque of x509, hash_alg: count): string

    This also changes the MIME types that we use to identify X.509
    certificates in SSL connections from "application/pkix-cert" to
    "application/x-x509-user-cert" for host certificates and
    "application/x-x509-ca-cert" for CA certificates.

  * The SSL scripts provide a new hook "ssl_finishing(c: connection)"
    to trigger actions after the handshake has concluded. (Johanna
    Amann)

  * Add an internal API for protocol analyzers to provide the MIME
    type of file data directly, disabling automatic inferrence.
    (Johanna Amann).

2.5-186 | 2017-07-28 12:22:20 -0700

  * Improved handling of '%' at end of line in HTTP analyzer. (Johanna
    Amann)

  * Add canonifier to catch and release test that should fix test
    failures. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-181 | 2017-07-25 16:02:41 -0700

  * Extend plugin infrastructure to catch Bro version mismatches at link
    time.

    The version number used for the function name is slightly normalized
    to skip any git revision postfixes (i.e., "2.5-xxx" is always treated
    as "2.5-git") so that one doesn't need to recompile all plugins after
    every master commit. That seems good enough, usually people run into
    this when upgrading to a new release. The Plugin API version is also
    part of the version number.

    If one loads an old plugin into a new Bro, the error message looks
    like this:

        $ bro -NN Demo::Foo
        fatal error in /home/robin/bro/master/scripts/base/init-bare.bro, line 1:
        cannot load plugin library /home/robin/tmp/p/build//lib/Demo-Foo.linux-x86_64.so:
        /home/robin/tmp/p/build//lib/Demo-Foo.linux-x86_64.so: undefined symbol: bro_version_2_5_git_debug

    (Robin Sommer)

  * Several fixes and improvements for software version parsing.

     - Addresses Philip Romero's question from the Bro mailing list.
     - Adds Microsoft Edge as a detected browser.
     - We are now unescaping encoded characters in software names. (Seth Hall)

  * Remove another reference to now removed bro-plugins. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-175 | 2017-07-07 14:35:11 -0700

  * Removing aux/plugins. Most of the plugins are now Bro packages.

    This fixes parsing of KRB_AP_Options where the padding and flags were reversed.

  * Add new cipher suites from draft-ietf-tls-ecdhe-psk-aead-05 (Johanna Amann)

  * Test changes: remove loading of listen.bro in tests that do not use it,
    serialize tests that load listen.bro, fix race conditions in some tests.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * The broccoli-v6addrs "-r" option was renamed to "-R" (Daniel Thayer)

2.5-156 | 2017-06-13 11:01:56 -0700

  * Add 2.5.1 news file to master. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix NFS protocol parser. (Julien Wallior)

2.5-142 | 2017-05-22 00:08:52 -0500

  * Add gzip log writing to the ascii writer.

    This feature can be enabled globally for all logs by setting
    LogAscii::gzip_level to a value greater than 0.

    This feature can be enabled on a per-log basis by setting gzip-level in
    $config to a value greater than 0. (Corelight)

2.5-140 | 2017-05-12 15:31:32 -0400

  * Lessen cluster load due to notice suppression.

  * Add rename, unlink, and rmdir bifs. (Corelight)

2.5-131 | 2017-04-21 14:27:16 -0700

  * Guard more format strings with __attribute__((format)). (Johanna Amann)

  * Add support for two TLS 1.3 extensions.

    New events:
        - event ssl_extension_supported_versions(c: connection, is_orig: bool, versions: index_vec)
        - event ssl_extension_psk_key_exchange_modes(c: connection, is_orig: bool, modes: index_vec) (Johanna Amann)

2.5-115 | 2017-03-23 07:25:41 -0700

  * Fix a test that was failing on some platforms. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Remove test for cluster catch and release. This test keeps failing
    intermittently because of timing issues that are surprisingly hard
    to fix. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix some Coverity warnings. (Daniel Thayer)

2.5-106 | 2017-03-13 11:19:03 -0700

    of printing it to stderr. Output is not an error output.  (Pete)

  * Fix compiler warning raised by llvm8. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix coverity warning in Ascii reader. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-101 | 2017-03-09 12:20:11 -0500

  * Input's framework's ascii reader is now more resilient.

    By default, the ASCII reader does not fail on errors anymore.
    If there is a problem parsing a line, a reporter warning is
    written and parsing continues.  If the file is missing or can't
    be read, the input thread just tries again on the next heartbeat.
    (Seth Hall, Johanna Amann)

2.5-92 | 2017-03-03 10:44:14 -0800

  * Move most threading to C++11 primitives (mostly). (Johanna Amann)

  * Remove build time warnings. (Seth Hall)

2.5-84 | 2017-02-27 15:08:55 -0500

  * Change semantics of Broker's remote logging to match old communication
    framework. (Robin Sommer)

  * Add and fix documentation for HookSetupAnalyzerTree (Johanna Amann)


2.5-76 | 2017-02-23 10:19:57 -0800

  * Kerberos ciphertext had some additional ASN.1 content being lumped
    in. (Vlad Grigorescu)

  * Updated Windows version detection to include Windows 10. (Fatema
    Bannatwala, Keith Lehigh, Mike, Seth Hall).

2.5-70 | 2017-02-20 00:20:02 -0500

  * Rework the RADIUS base script.

    Fixes BIT-1769 which improves logging behavior when replies aren't
    seen.  Also added a `framed_addr` field to indicate if the radius
    server is hinting at an address for the client and a `ttl` field to
    show how quickly the server is responding. (Seth Hall)

2.5-68 | 2017-02-18 13:59:05 -0500

  * Refactored base krb scripts. (Seth Hall)

  * New script to log ticket hashes in krb log
    (policy/protocols/krb/ticket-logging.bro).  Also, add

2.5-62 | 2017-02-15 15:56:38 -0800

  * Fix case in which scripts were able to access unitialized variables
    in certain cases. Addresses BIT-1785. (Jon Siwek)

2.5-60 | 2017-02-15 15:19:20 -0800

  * Implement ERSPAN support.

    There is a small caveat to this implementation.  The ethernet
    header that is carried over the tunnel is ignored.  If a user
    tries to do MAC address logging, it will only show the MAC
    addresses for the outer tunnel and the inner MAC addresses
    will be stripped and not available anywhere. (Seth Hall)

  * Tiny mime-type fix from Dan Caselden. (Seth Hall)

  * Update failing intel framework test. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-55 | 2017-02-10 09:50:43 -0500

  * Fixed intel expiration reset. Reinserting the same indicator did not reset
    the expiration timer for the indicator in the underlying data store.
    Addresses BIT-1790. (Jan Grashoefer)

2.5-51 | 2017-02-06 10:15:56 -0500

  * Fix memory leak in file analyzer. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix a series of problems with the to_json function.
    Addresses BIT-1788. (Daniel Thayer)

2.5-44 | 2017-02-03 16:38:10 -0800

  * Change snap lengths of some tests. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix layer 2 connection flipping. If connection flipping occured in
    Sessions.cc code (invoked e.g. when the original SYN is missing),
    layer 2 flipping was not performed. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-39 | 2017-02-01 14:03:08 -0800

  * Fix file analyzer memory management, and a delay in disabling file analyzers.
    File analyzers are no longer deleted immediately; this is delayed until
    a file opject is destroyed. Furthermore, no data is sent to file analyzers
    anymore after they have been disabled.

2.5-33 | 2017-02-01 10:07:47 -0500

  * New file types sigs. (Keith Lehigh)

  * Change snaplen of test trace from 1,000,000 to 10,000

    Recent versions of libpcap are unhappy with values bigger than 262,144
    and will refuse reading the file. (Johanna Amann)


2.5-30 | 2017-01-26 13:24:36 -0800

  * Extend file extraction log, adding extracted_cutoff and extracted_size
    fields. (Seth Hall)

  * Add new TLS extension type (cached_info) (Johanna Amann)

  * Remove brocon event; it caused test failures. (Johanna Amann)

  * Add missing paths to SMB Log::create_streams calls. (Johanna Amann)

  * Tiny xlsx file signature fix. (Dan Caselden)

    Addresses BIT-1758. (Francois Pennaneac)

2.5-17 | 2016-12-07 14:51:37 -0800

  * Broxygen no longer attempts to do tilde expansion of PATH, giving
    an error message instead if bro is located in a PATH component
    that starts with a tilde. Broxygen also no longer attempts to get
    the mtime of the bro executable when bro is not invoced with the
    "-X" option. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix failing tests, compiler warnings and build issues on OpenBSD.
    (Daniel Thayer)

2.5-9 | 2016-12-05 11:39:54 -0800

  * Fix validation of OCSP replies inside of Bro. (Johanna Amann)

    At one place in the code, we did not check the correct return
    code. This makes it possible for a reply to get a response of
    "good", when the OCSP reply is not actually signed by the
    responder in question.

    This also instructs OCSP verication to skip certificate chain
    validation, which we do ourselves earlier because the OCSP verify
    function cannot do it correctly (no way to pass timestamp).

2.5-6 | 2016-11-29 12:51:04 -0800

  * Fix a build failure on OpenBSD relating to pcap_pkthdr. Also fixes
    an include issue on OpenBSD. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix compile error in krb-types.pac. (Johanna Amann)

  * Update krb-types.pac: KerberosString formatting for the principal
    principal name is now compliant with RFC 4120 section 5.2.2. (jamesecorrenti)

2.5 | 2016-11-16 14:51:59 -0800

  * Improve the "How to Upgrade" page in the Bro docs. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Update the quickstart guide for the deploy command. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Improved installation instructions for Mac OS X. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Lots of more small updates to documentation. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Release 2.5-beta2.

2.5-beta-135 | 2016-11-02 09:47:20 -0700

  * SMB fixes and cleanup. Includes better SMB error handling, improved DCE_RPC
    handling in edge cases where drive_mapping is not seen. The concept of unknown
    shares has been removed with this change. Also fixes SMB tree connect handling and
    removes files that are not parsed. SMB2 error parsing is disabled because it never
    was implemented correctly. (Seth Hall)

  * Including a test for raw NTLM in SMB (Seth Hall)

  * Updates for SMB auth handling from Martin van Hensbergen.

     - Raw NTLM (not in GSSAPI) over SMB is now handled correctly.
     - The encrypted NTLM session key is now passed into scriptland
       through the ntlm_authenticate event. (Seth Hall)

  * Add a files framework signature for VIM tmp files. (Seth Hall)

  * Version parsing scripts now supports several beta versions. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-beta-123 | 2016-11-01 09:40:49 -0700

2.5-beta-91 | 2016-10-20 11:40:37 -0400

  * Fix istate.pybroccoli test on systems using Python 3. (Daniel Thayer)

2.5-beta-89 | 2016-10-18 21:50:51 -0400

  * SSH analyzer changes: the events are now restructured a bit. There is a new
    event ssh_auth_attempted, that is raised each time authentication is tried.
    ssh_auth_failed is still only being raised once per connection. There also
    is an additional event ssh_auth_result giving more information about the
    number of times that authentication was tried and if it succeded/failed in
    the end. The number of authentication attemps are now part of ssh.log.
    Addresses BIT-1641. (Vlad Grigorescu)

2.5-beta-79 | 2016-10-13 15:58:48 -0700

  * Fix MD5 problem with FreeBSD 11.0 and clang 3.8. The apparent
    cause is some confusion in clang when using a static char inside a
    static inline function that is refered to several compilation
    units. (Johanna Amann)

  * Initial TLS 1.3 support, as of draft-16. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-beta-73 | 2016-10-13 14:03:04 -0700

      - Fixed an issue with the DCE_RPC signature not working for IPv6
        connections.

2.5-beta-64 | 2016-10-10 08:20:42 -0700

  * Fix httpd.py test script for Py3 compatibility. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Tiny fix for a DCE_RPC script issue. Fixes BIT-1688. (Seth Hall)

  * Fix for plugins/hooks test. (Johanna Amann)

  * Update a TLS constants in preparation for TLS 1.3, and rename a
    few names that had never been formally assigned yet. (Johanna
    Amann)

  * Fixing Broxygen indexing confusion for plugins. Broxygen now
    indexes plugin scripts as, e.g., "Bro_Netmap/scripts/init.bro".
    Addresses BIT-1693. (Robin Sommer)

    (Robin Sommer)

  * Improve the SMB documentation. (Vlad Grigorescu)

2.5-beta-46 | 2016-10-06 14:11:03 -0700

  * Fixing Broxygen indexing confusion for plugins. Scripts in plugins now
    get an artificial index prefix: "plugin_name/", followed by the script's
    relative path inside the plugin's top-level directory. For example,
    "/opt/bro/lib/bro/plugins/Bro_Netmap/scripts/init.bro" now turns into
    "Bro_Netmap/scripts/init.bro" for Broxygen purposes (whereas it used to
    be just "init.bro"). (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix a couple of tests, addressing issues of the newly introduced version.bro
    as well as small FreeBSD 11.0 issues. (Johanna Amann)

  * Update documentation license. (Johanna Amann)

  * Add a convenient way to access version information to Bro.

      @if ( Version::number >= 20500 )
      or
      @if ( Version::at_least("2.5") )

      Version::info contains detailed information about the running version of
      Bro, including beta flags, etc. (Johanna Amann)

2.5-beta-21 | 2016-09-26 10:15:23 -0700

  * Fix a debugger bug where it would not support statements like print(3).
    Addresses BIT-1703. (Vlad Grigorescu)

  * Make x509 intel seen script more robust (Johanna Amann)

  * Input: DisableFrontend was not called upon Init failure. (Johanna Amann)

  * DCE_RPC code simplification. (Seth Hall)

  * Add logging framework ext-data mechanism. It is now possible to
    extend logs by adding new data columns by them - either to specific
    ones, or globally to all logs. This can, e.g., be used to add node
    names to all logs. (Seth Hall)

  * Add unrolling separator & field name map to logging framework.

2.4-885 | 2016-08-05 15:03:59 -0700

  * Reverting SMB analyzer merge. (Robin Sommer)

2.4-883 | 2016-08-05 12:57:26 -0400

  * Add a new node type for logging with the cluster framework scripts by
    adding a new Bro node type for doing logging (this is intended to
    reduce the load on the manager). If a user chooses not to specify a
    logger node in the cluster configuration, then the manager will
    write logs locally as usual. (Daniel Thayer)

2.4-874 | 2016-08-05 12:43:06 -0400

  * SMB analyzer (Seth Hall, Vlad Grigorescu and many others)

    (Anony Mous)

2.4-729 | 2016-08-01 08:00:54 -0700

  * Fix behavior of connection_pending event. It is now really only
    raised when Bro is terminating. Also adds a test-case that raises
    the event. (Johanna Amann)

  * Retired remove -J/-K options (set md5/hash key) from the manpage.
    They had already been removed from the code. (Johanna Amann)

  * NetControl: Add catch-and-release event when IPs are forgotten.
    This adds an event catch_release_forgotten() that is raised once
    Catch & Release ceases block management for an IP address because
    the IP has not been seen in traffic during the watch interval.
    (Johanna Amann)

2.4-723 | 2016-07-26 15:04:26 -0700

  * Add error events to input framework. (Johanna Amann)

    This change introduces error events for Table and Event readers.
    Users can now specify an event that is called when an info,
    warning, or error is emitted by their input reader. This can,
    e.g., be used to raise notices in case errors occur when reading
    an important input stream.

    Example:

        event error_event(desc: Input::TableDescription, msg: string, level: Reporter::Level)
            {
            ...
            }

        event bro_init()
            {
            Input::add_table([$source="a", $error_ev=error_event, ...]);
            }

     Addresses BIT-1181.

  * Calling Error() in an input reader now automatically will disable
    the reader and return a failure in the Update/Heartbeat calls.
    (Johanna Amann)

  * Convert all errors in the ASCII formatter into warnings (to show
    that they are non-fatal. (Johanna Amann)

    https://www.sqlite.org/sharedcache.html. Addresses BIT-1325.
    (Johanna Amann)

  * NetControl: Adjust default priority of ACTION_DROP hook to standad
    level. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix types when constructing SYN_packet record. Fixes BIT-1650.
    (Grant Moyer).

  * Deprecated the ElasticSearch log writer. (Johanna Amann)

2.4-709 | 2016-07-15 09:05:20 -0700

  * Change Bro's hashing for short inputs and Bloomfilters from H3 to
    Siphash, which produces much better results for HLL in particular.
    (Johanna Amann)

    Addresses BIT-1645. (Daniel Thayer)

2.4-686 | 2016-07-08 19:14:43 -0700

  * Added flagging of retransmission to the connection history.
    Addresses BIT-977. (Robin Sommer)

2.4-683 | 2016-07-08 14:55:04 -0700

  * Extending connection history field to flag with '^' when Bro flips
    a connection's endpoints. Addresses BIT-1629. (Robin Sommer)

2.4-680 | 2016-07-06 09:18:21 -0700

  * Remove ack_above_hole() event, which was a subset of content_gap
    and led to plenty noise. Addresses BIT-688. (Robin Sommer)

2.4-679 | 2016-07-05 16:35:53 -0700

    treat it as such. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fixing control framework's net_stats and peer_status commands. For
    the latter, this removes most of the values returned, as we don't

2.4-115 | 2015-08-30 21:57:35 -0700

  * Enable Bro to leverage packet fanout mode on Linux. (Kris
    Nielander).

       ## Toggle whether to do packet fanout (Linux-only).
       const Pcap::packet_fanout_enable = F &redef;

       ## If packet fanout is enabled, the id to sue for it. This should be shared amongst
       ## worker processes processing the same socket.
       const Pcap::packet_fanout_id = 0 &redef;

       ## If packet fanout is enabled, whether packets are to be defragmented before
       ## fanout is applied.
       const Pcap::packet_fanout_defrag = T &redef;

  * Allow libpcap buffer size to be set via configuration. (Kris Nielander)

       ## Number of Mbytes to provide as buffer space when capturing from live
       ## interfaces.
       const Pcap::bufsize = 128 &redef;

  * Move the pcap-related script-level identifiers into the new Pcap
    namespace. (Robin Sommer)

        snaplen                  -> Pcap::snaplen
        precompile_pcap_filter() -> Pcap::precompile_pcap_filter()

2.4-108 | 2015-08-30 20:14:31 -0700

   * Update Base64 decoding.  (Jan Grashoefer)

        - A new built-in function, decode_base64_conn() for Base64
          decoding. It works like decode_base64() but receives an
          additional connection argument that will be used for
          reporting decoding errors into weird.log (instead of
          reporter.log).

        - FTP, POP3, and HTTP analyzers now likewise log Base64
          decoding errors to weird.log.

        - The built-in functions decode_base64_custom() and
          encode_base64_custom() are now deprecated. Their
          functionality is provided directly by decode_base64() and
          encode_base64(), which take an optional parameter to change
          the Base64 alphabet.

  * Fix potential crash if TCP header was captured incompletely.
    (Robin Sommer)

2.4-103 | 2015-08-29 10:51:55 -0700

  * Make ASN.1 date/time parsing more robust. (Johanna Amann)

2.4-84 | 2015-08-10 14:44:39 -0700

  * Add hook 'HookSetupAnalyzerTree' to allow plugins access to a
    connection's initial analyzer tree for customization. (James
    Swaro)

  * Plugins now look for a file "__preload__.bro" in the top-level
    script directory. If found, they load it first, before any scripts
    defining BiF elements. This can be used to define types that the
    BiFs already depend on (like a custom type for an event argument).
    (Robin Sommer)

2.4-81 | 2015-08-08 07:38:42 -0700

    (Jon Siwek)

2.4-45 | 2015-07-21 15:19:43 -0700

  * Enabling Broker by default. This means CAF is now a required
    dependency, altjough for now at least, there's still a switch
    --disable-broker to turn it off.

    Sommer)

  * Tweaking the listing of hooks in "bro -NN" for consistency. (Robin

    ignore content. (Robin Sommer)

2.4-19 | 2015-07-03 09:04:54 -0700

  * A set of tests exercising IP defragmentation and TCP reassembly.
    (Robin Sommer)

2.4-17 | 2015-06-28 13:02:41 -0700

  * BIT-1314: Add detection for Quantum Insert attacks. The TCP
    reassembler can now keep a history of old TCP segments using the
    tcp_max_old_segments option. An overlapping segment with different
    data will then generate an rexmit_inconsistency event. The default
    for tcp_max_old_segments is zero, which disabled any additional
    buffering. (Yun Zheng Hu/Robin Sommer)

2.4-14 | 2015-06-28 12:30:12 -0700

  * BIT-1400: Allow '<' and '>' in MIME multipart boundaries. The spec
    doesn't actually seem to permit these, but they seem to occur in
    the wild. (Jon Siwek)

2.4-12 | 2015-06-28 12:21:11 -0700

  * BIT-1399: Trying to decompress deflated HTTP content even when
    zlib headers are missing. (Seth Hall)

2.4-10 | 2015-06-25 07:11:17 -0700

  * Fixing compile problem caused by overeager factorization. (Robin
    Sommer)

2.3-874 | 2015-04-21 16:09:20 -0700

  * Change details of escaping when logging/printing. (Seth Hall/Robin
    Sommer)

        - Log files now escape non-printable characters consistently
          as "\xXX'. Furthermore, backslashes are escaped as "\\",
          making the representation fully reversible.

        - When escaping via script-level functions (escape_string,
          clean), we likewise now escape consistently with "\xXX" and
          "\\".

        - There's no "alternative" output style anymore, i.e., fmt()
          '%A' qualifier is gone.

    Addresses BIT-1333.

  * Remove several BroString escaping methods that are no longer
    useful. (Seth Hall)

2.3-864 | 2015-04-21 15:24:02 -0700

  * A SIP protocol analyzer. (Vlad Grigorescu)

	Activity gets logged into sip.log. It generates the following
    events:

	    event sip_request(c: connection, method: string, original_URI: string, version: string);
        event sip_reply(c: connection, version: string, code: count, reason: string);
        event sip_header(c: connection, is_orig: bool, name: string, value: string);

    Grigorescu)

2.3-835 | 2015-04-21 16:36:00 -0500

  * Clarify Broker examples. (Jon Siwek)

2.3-833 | 2015-04-21 12:38:32 -0700

  * A Kerberos protocol analyzer. (Vlad Grigorescu)

	Activity gets logged into kerberos.log. It generates the following
    events:

        event krb_as_request(c: connection, msg: KRB::KDC_Request);
        event krb_as_response(c: connection, msg: KRB::KDC_Response);
        event krb_tgs_request(c: connection, msg: KRB::KDC_Request);
        event krb_tgs_response(c: connection, msg: KRB::KDC_Response);
        event krb_ap_request(c: connection, ticket: KRB::Ticket, opts: KRB::AP_Options);
        event krb_priv(c: connection, is_orig: bool);
        event krb_safe(c: connection, is_orig: bool, msg: KRB::SAFE_Msg);
        event krb_cred(c: connection, is_orig: bool, tickets: KRB::Ticket_Vector);
        event krb_error(c: connection, msg: KRB::Error_Msg);

2.3-793 | 2015-04-20 20:51:00 -0700

  * Add decoding of PROXY-AUTHORIZATION header to HTTP analyze,
    treating it the same as AUTHORIZATION. (Josh Liburdi)

  * Remove deprecated fields "hot" and "addl" from the connection
    record. Remove the functions append_addl() and
    append_addl_marker(). (Robin Sommer)

  * Removing the NetFlow analyzer, which hasn't been used anymore
    since then corresponding command-line option went away. (Robin
    Sommer)

2.3-787 | 2015-04-20 19:15:23 -0700

  * A file analyzer for Portable Executables. (Vlad Grigorescu/Seth
    Hall).

	Activity gets logged into pe.log. It generates the following
	events:

        event pe_dos_header(f: fa_file, h: PE::DOSHeader);
        event pe_dos_code(f: fa_file, code: string);
        event pe_file_header(f: fa_file, h: PE::FileHeader);
        event pe_optional_header(f: fa_file, h: PE::OptionalHeader);
        event pe_section_header(f: fa_file, h: PE::SectionHeader);

2.3-741 | 2015-04-20 13:12:39 -0700

  * API changes to file analysis mime type detection. Removed
    "file_mime_type" and "file_mime_types" event, replacing them with
    a new event called "file_metadata_inferred". Addresses BIT-1368.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * A large series of improvements for file type identification. This
    inludes a many signature updates (new types, cleanup, performance
    improvments) and splitting out signatures into subfiles. (Seth
    Hall)

  * Fix an issue with files having gaps before the bof_buffer is
    filled, which could lead to file type identification not working
    correctly. (Seth Hall)

  * Fix an issue with packet loss in HTTP file reporting for file type
    identification wasn't working correctly zero-length bodies. (Seth
    Hall)

  * X.509 certificates are now populating files.log with the mime type
    application/pkix-cert. (Seth Hall)

  * Normalized some FILE_ANALYSIS debug messages. (Seth Hall)

2.3-725 | 2015-04-20 12:54:54 -0700

  * Updating submodule(s).

2.3-724 | 2015-04-20 14:11:02 -0500

  * Fix uninitialized field in raw input reader. (Jon Siwek)

  * Updating NEWS.

2.3-716 | 2015-04-17 13:06:37 -0700

  * Add seeking functionality to raw reader. One can now add an option
    "offset" to the config map. Positive offsets are interpreted to be
    from the beginning of the file, negative from the end of the file
    (-1 is end of file). Only works for raw reader in streaming or
    manual mode. Does not work with executables. Addresses BIT-985.
    (Johanna Amann)

  * Allow setting packet and byte thresholds for connections. (Johanna Amann)

    This extends the ConnSize analyzer to be able to raise events when
    each direction of a connection crosses a certain amount of bytes
    or packets.

    Thresholds are set using:
        - set_conn_bytes_threshold(c$id, [num-bytes], [direction]);
        - set_conn_packets_threshold(c$id, [num-packets], [direction]);

    They raise the events, respectively:
        - event conn_bytes_threshold_crossed(c: connection, threshold: count, is_orig: bool)
        - event conn_packets_threshold_crossed(c: connection, threshold: count, is_orig: bool)

    Current thresholds can be examined using get_conn_bytes_threshold()
    and get_conn_packets_threshold().

    Only one threshold can be set per connection.

  * Add high-level API for packet/bytes thresholding in
    base/protocols/conn/thresholds.bro that holds lists of thresholds
    and raises an event for each threshold exactly once. (Johanna
    Amann)

  * Fix a bug where child packet analyzers of the TCP analyzer
    where not found using FindChild.

  * Update GridFTP analyzer to use connection thresholding instead of
    polling. (Johanna Amann)

2.3-709 | 2015-04-17 12:37:32 -0700

  * Fix addressing the dreaded "internal error: unknown msg type 115
  in Poll()". (Jon Siwek)

    This patch removes the error handling code for overload conditions
    in the main process that could cause trouble down the road. The
    "chunked_io_buffer_soft_cap" script variable can now tune when the
    client process begins shutting down peer connections, and the

    See aux/broker/README for more information on Broker, and
    doc/frameworks/comm.rst for the corresponding Bro script API.

    Broker support is by default off for now; it can be enabled at
    configure time with --enable-broker. It requires CAF
    (https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework); for now iot
    needs CAF's "develop" branch. Broker also requires a C++11
    compiler.

    Broker will become a mandatory dependency in future Bro versions.

  * Add --enable-c++11 configure flag to compile Bro's source code in
    C++11 mode with a corresponding compiler. (Jon Siwek)

    than replacing. (Robin Sommer)

  * Creating the installation directory for plugins at install time.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Deprecate split* family of BIFs. (Jon Siwek)

    These functions are now deprecated in favor of alternative versions that
    return a vector of strings rather than a table of strings.

    Deprecated functions:

    - split: use split_string instead.
    - split1: use split_string1 instead.
    - split_all: use split_string_all instead.
    - split_n: use split_string_n instead.
    - cat_string_array: see join_string_vec instead.
    - cat_string_array_n: see join_string_vec instead.
    - join_string_array: see join_string_vec instead.
    - sort_string_array: use sort instead instead.
    - find_ip_addresses: use extract_ip_addresses instead.

    Changed functions:

    - has_valid_octets: uses a string_vec parameter instead of string_array.

    Addresses BIT-924.

  * Add a new attribute: &deprecated. While scripts are parsed, a
    warning is raised for each usage of an identifier marked as
    &deprecated.  This also works for BIFs. Addresses BIT-924,
    BIT-757. (Jon Siwek)

     - Reorganized MS signatures into a separate file.

     - Remove all of the x-c detections.  Nearly all false positives.

     - Improve TAR detections, removing old, back up TAR detections.

     - Remove one of the x-elc detections that was too loose
       and caused many false positives.

     - Improved lots of the signatures and added new ones. (Seth Hall)

  * Add support for file reassembly in the file analysis framework
    (Seth Hall, Jon Siwek).

     - The reassembly behavior can be modified per-file by enabling or
       disabling the reassembler and/or modifying the size of the
       reassembly buffer.

     - Changed the file extraction analyzer to use stream-wise input to
       avoid issues with the chunk-wise approach not immediately
       triggering the file_new event due to mime-type detection delay.
       Before, early chunks frequently ended up lost.  Extraction also
       will now explicitly NUL-fill gaps in the file instead of
       implicitly relying on pwrite to do it.

2.3-83 | 2014-07-30 16:26:11 -0500

  * Minor adjustments to plugin code/docs. (Jon Siwek)

  * Dynamic plugin support. (Rpbin Sommer)

    Bro now supports extending core functionality, like protocol and
    file analysis, dynamically with external plugins in the form of
    shared libraries. See doc/devel/plugins.rst for an overview of the
    main functionality. Changes coming with this:

        - Replacing the old Plugin macro magic with a new API.

        - The plugin API changed to generally use std::strings instead
          of const char*.

        - There are a number of invocations of PLUGIN_HOOK_
          {VOID,WITH_RESULT} across the code base, which allow plugins
          to hook into the processing at those locations.

        - A few new accessor methods to various classes to allow
          plugins to get to that information.

        - network_time cannot be just assigned to anymore, there's now
          function net_update_time() for that.

        - Redoing how builtin variables are initialized, so that it
          works for plugins as well. No more init_net_var(), but
          instead bifcl-generated code that registers them.

        - Various changes for adjusting to the now dynamic generation
          of analyzer instances.

    - same_type() gets an optional extra argument allowing record type
      comparision to ignore if field names don't match. (Robin Sommer)

    - Further unify file analysis API with the protocol analyzer API
      (assigning IDs to analyzers; adding Init()/Done() methods;
      adding subtypes). (Robin Sommer)

    - A new command line option -Q that prints some basic execution
      time stats. (Robin Sommer)

    - Add support to the file analysis for activating analyzers by
      MIME type. (Robin Sommer)

          - File::register_for_mime_type(tag: Analyzer::Tag, mt:
            string): Associates a file analyzer with a MIME type.

          - File::add_analyzers_for_mime_type(f: fa_file, mtype:
            string): Activates all analyzers registered for a MIME
            type for the file.

          - The default file_new() handler calls
            File::add_analyzers_for_mime_type() with the file's MIME
            type.

2.3-20 | 2014-07-22 17:41:02 -0700

  * Updating submodule(s).

  * Add two more SSL events, one triggered for each handshake message
    and one triggered for the tls change cipherspec message. (Johanna
    Amann)

  * Small SSL bug fix. In case SSL::disable_analyzer_after_detection
    was set to false, the ssl_established event would fire after each
    data packet once the session is established. (Johanna Amann)

2.3-beta-16 | 2014-06-06 13:05:44 -0700

  * Add a new section "Cluster Configuration" to the docs that is
    intended as a how-to for configuring a Bro cluster.  Most of this
    content was moved here from the BroControl doc (which is now
    intended as more of a reference guide for more experienced users)
    and the load balancing FAQ on the website. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Update some doc tests and line numbers (Daniel Thayer)

2.2-457 | 2014-05-16 14:38:31 -0700

  * New script policy/protocols/ssl/validate-ocsp.bro that adds OSCP
    validation to ssl.log. The work is done by a new bif
    x509_ocsp_verify(). (Johanna Amann)

  * STARTTLS support for POP3 and SMTP. The SSL analyzer takes over
    when seen. smtp.log now logs when a connection switches to SSL.

2.2-441 | 2014-05-15 11:29:56 -0700

  * A new RADIUS analyzer. (Vlad Grigorescu)

    It produces a radius.log and generates two events:

        event radius_message(c: connection, result: RADIUS::Message);
        event radius_attribute(c: connection, attr_type: count, value: string);

2.2-427 | 2014-05-15 13:37:23 -0400

  * Fix dynamic SumStats update on clusters (Johanna Amann)

2.2-425 | 2014-05-08 16:34:44 -0700

  * Fix reassembly of data w/ sizes beyond 32-bit capacities. (Jon Siwek)

    Reassembly code (e.g. for TCP) now uses int64/uint64 (signedness
    is situational) data types in place of int types in order to
    support delivering data to analyzers that pass 2GB thresholds.
    There's also changes in logic that accompany the change in data
    types, e.g. to fix TCP sequence space arithmetic inconsistencies.

    Another significant change is in the Analyzer API: the *Packet and
    *Undelivered methods now use a uint64 in place of an int for the
    relative sequence space offset parameter.

    Addresses BIT-348.

  * Fixing compiler warnings. (Robin Sommer)

  * Add SNMP datagram parsing support.This supports parsing of SNMPv1
    (RFC 1157), SNMPv2 (RFC 1901/3416), and SNMPv2 (RFC 3412).  An
    event is raised for each SNMP PDU type, though there's not
    currently any event handlers for them and not a default snmp.log
    either.  However, simple presence of SNMP is currently visible now
    in conn.log service field and known_services.log. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-304 | 2014-03-30 23:05:54 +0200

  * Replace libmagic w/ Bro signatures for file MIME type
    identification. Addresses BIT-1143. (Jon Siwek)

    Includes:

    - libmagic is no longer used at all.  All MIME type detection is
      done through new Bro signatures, and there's no longer a means
      to get verbose file type descriptions. The majority of the
      default file magic signatures are derived from the default magic
      database of libmagic ~5.17.

    - File magic signatures consist of two new constructs in the
      signature rule parsing grammar: "file-magic" gives a regular
      expression to match against, and "file-mime" gives the MIME type
      string of content that matches the magic and an optional strength
      value for the match.

    - Modified signature/rule syntax for identifiers: they can no
      longer start with a '-', which made for ambiguous syntax when
      doing negative strength values in "file-mime".  Also brought
      syntax for Bro script identifiers in line with reality (they
      can't start with numbers or include '-' at all).

    - A new built-in function, "file_magic", can be used to get all
      file magic matches and their corresponding strength against a
      given chunk of data.

    - The second parameter of the "identify_data" built-in function
      can no longer be used to get verbose file type descriptions,
      though it can still be used to get the strongest matching file
      magic signature.

    - The "file_transferred" event's "descr" parameter no longer
      contains verbose file type descriptions.

    - The BROMAGIC environment variable no longer changes any behavior
      in Bro as magic databases are no longer used/installed.

    - Removed "binary" and "octet-stream" mime type detections. They
      don' provide any more information than an uninitialized
      mime_type field which implicitly means no magic signature
      matches and so the media type is unknown to Bro.

    - The "fa_file" record now contains a "mime_types" field that
      contains all magic signatures that matched the file content
      (where the "mime_type" field is just a shortcut for the
      strongest match).

    - Reverted back to minimum requirement of CMake 2.6.3 from 2.8.0.

  * The logic for adding file ids to {orig,resp}_fuids fields of the
    http.log incorrectly depended on the state of
    {orig,resp}_mime_types fields, so sometimes not all file ids
    associated w/ the session were logged. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix MHR script's use of fa_file$mime_type before checking if it's
    initialized. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-294 | 2014-03-30 22:08:25 +0200

  * Rework and move X509 certificate processing from the SSL protocol
    analyzer to a dedicated file analyzer. This will allow us to
    examine X509 certificates from sources other than SSL in the
    future. Furthermore, Bro now parses more fields and extensions
    from the certificates (e.g. elliptic curve information, subject
    alternative names, basic constraints). Certificate validation also
    was improved, should be easier to use and exposes information like
    the full verified certificate chain. (Johanna Amann)

    This update changes the format of ssl.log and adds a new x509.log
    with certificate information. Furthermore all x509 events and
    handling functions have changed.

2.2-271 | 2014-03-30 20:25:17 +0200

  * Add unit tests covering vector/set/table ctors/inits. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix parsing of "local" named table constructors. (Jon Siwek)

    (Daniel Thayer)

2.2-263 | 2014-03-30 20:19:05 +0200

  * Don't include locations into serialization when cloning values.
    (Robin Sommer)

2.2-262 | 2014-03-30 20:12:47 +0200

  * Refactor SerializationFormat::EndWrite and ChunkedIO::Chunk memory
    management. (Jon Siwek)

  * Improve SerializationFormat's write buffer growth strategy. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Add --parse-only option to exit after parsing scripts. May be
    useful for syntax-checking tools. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-256 | 2014-03-30 19:57:28 +0200

  * For the summary statistics framewirk, change all &create_expire
    attributes to &read_expire in the cluster part. (Johanna Amann)

2.2-248 | 2014-03-19 14:47:40 -0400

  * Make SumStats work incrementally and non-blocking in non-cluster
    mode, but force it to operate by blocking if Bro is shutting
    down. (Seth Hall)

2.2-244 | 2014-03-17 08:24:17 -0700

  * Fix compile errror on FreeBSD caused by wrong include file order.
    (Johanna Amann)

2.2-240 | 2014-03-14 10:23:54 -0700

    mode. Addresses BIT-1134. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixing a few cases of undefined behaviour introduced by recent
    formatter work.

  * Fixing compiler error. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixing (very unlikely) double delete in HTTP analyzer when
    decapsulating CONNECTs. (Robin Sommer)

2.2-235 | 2014-03-13 16:21:19 -0700

  * The Ascii writer has a new option LogAscii::use_json for writing
	out logs as JSON. (Seth Hall)

  * Ascii input reader now supports all config options as per-input
    stream "config" values. (Seth Hall)

  * Refactored formatters and updated the the writers a bit. (Seth
	Hall)

2.2-229 | 2014-03-13 14:58:30 -0700

  * Refactoring analyzer manager code to reuse
    ApplyScheduledAnalyzers(). (Robin Sommer)

2.2-228 | 2014-03-13 14:25:53 -0700

  * Teach async DNS lookup builtin-functions about BRO_DNS_FAKE.
    Addresses BIT-1134. (Jon Siwek)

  * Enable fake DNS mode for test suites.

  * Improve analysis of TCP SYN/SYN-ACK reversal situations. (Jon
    Siwek)

    - Since it's just the handshake packets out of order, they're no
      longer treated as partial connections, which some protocol analyzers
      immediately refuse to look at.

    - The TCP_Reassembler "is_orig" state failed to change, which led to
      protocol analyzers sometimes using the wrong value for that.

    - Add a unit test which exercises the Connection::FlipRoles() code
      path (i.e. the SYN/SYN-ACK reversal situation).

    Addresses BIT-1148.

  * Fix bug in Connection::FlipRoles. It didn't swap address values
    right and also didn't consider that analyzers might be scheduled
    for the new connection tuple. Reported by Kevin McMahon. Addresses
    BIT-1148. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-221 | 2014-03-12 17:23:18 -0700

  * Teach configure script --enable-jemalloc, --with-jemalloc.
    Addresses BIT-1128. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-218 | 2014-03-12 17:19:45 -0700

  * Improve DBG_LOG macro (perf. improvement for --enable-debug mode).
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Silences some documentation warnings from Sphinx. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-215 | 2014-03-10 11:10:15 -0700

  * Fix non-deterministic logging of unmatched DNS msgs. Addresses
    BIT-1153 (Jon Siwek)

2.2-213 | 2014-03-09 08:57:37 -0700

  * No longer accidentally attempting to parse NBSTAT RRs as SRV RRs
    in DNS analyzer. (Seth Hall)

  * Fix DNS SRV responses and a small issue with NBNS queries and
    label length. (Seth Hall)

     - DNS SRV responses never had the code written to actually
       generate the dns_SRV_reply event.  Adding this required
       extending the event a bit to add extra information.  SRV responses
       now appear in the dns.log file correctly.

     - Fixed an issue where some Microsoft NetBIOS Name Service lookups
       would exceed the max label length for DNS and cause an incorrect
       "DNS_label_too_long" weird.

2.2-210 | 2014-03-06 22:52:36 -0500

  * Improve SSL logging so that connections are logged even when the
    ssl_established event is not generated as well as other small SSL
    fixes. (Johanna Amann)

2.2-206 | 2014-03-03 16:52:28 -0800

  * HTTP CONNECT proxy support. The HTTP analyzer now supports
    handling HTTP CONNECT proxies. (Seth Hall)

  * Expanding the HTTP methods used in the DPD signature to detect
    HTTP traffic. (Seth Hall)

  * Fixing removal of support analyzers. (Robin Sommer)

2.2-199 | 2014-03-03 16:34:20 -0800

  * Allow iterating over bif functions with result type vector of any.
    This changes the internal type that is used to signal that a
    vector is unspecified from any to void. Addresses BIT-1144
    (Johanna Amann)

2.2-197 | 2014-02-28 15:36:58 -0800

  * Remove test code. (Robin Sommer)

  * More Google TLS extensions that are being actively used. Johanna(
    Amann)

2.2-173 | 2014-02-14 10:50:15 -0800

  * Fix misidentification of SOCKS traffic that in particiular seemed
    to happen a lot with DCE/RPC traffic. (Vlad Grigorescu)

2.2-170 | 2014-02-13 16:42:07 -0800

  * Refactor DNS script's state management to improve performance.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Revert "Expanding the HTTP methods used in the signature to detect
    HTTP traffic." (Robin Sommer)

2.2-167 | 2014-02-12 20:17:39 -0800

  * Increase timeouts of some unit tests. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix memory leak in modbus analyzer. Would happen if there's a
    'modbus_read_fifo_queue_response' event handler. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add channel_id TLS extension number. This number is not IANA
    defined, but we see it being actively used. (Johanna Amann)

  * Test baseline updates for DNS change. (Robin Sommer)

2.2-158 | 2014-02-09 23:45:39 -0500

  * Change dns.log to include only standard DNS queries. (Jon Siwek)

  * Improve DNS analysis. (Jon Siwek)

    - Fix parsing of empty question sections (when QDCOUNT == 0).  In this
      case, the DNS parser would extract two 2-byte fields for use in either
      "dns_query_reply" or "dns_rejected" events (dependent on value of
      RCODE) as qclass and qtype parameters.  This is not correct, because
      such fields don't actually exist in the DNS message format when
      QDCOUNT is 0.  As a result, these events are no longer raised when
      there's an empty question section.  Scripts that depends on checking
      for an empty question section can do that in the "dns_message" event.

    - Add a new "dns_unknown_reply" event, for when Bro does not know how
      to fully parse a particular resource record type.  This helps fix a
      problem in the default DNS scripts where the logic to complete
      request-reply pair matching doesn't work because it's waiting on more
      RR events to complete the reply.  i.e. it expects ANCOUNT number of
      dns_*_reply events and will wait until it gets that many before
      completing a request-reply pair and logging it to dns.log.  This could
      cause bogus replies to match a previous request if they happen to
      share a DNS transaction ID. (Jon Siwek)

    - The previous method of matching queries with replies was still
      unreliable in cases where the reply contains no answers.  The new code
      also takes extra measures to avoid pending state growing too large in
      cases where the condition to match a query with a corresponding reply is
      never met, but yet DNS messages continue to be exchanged over the same
      connection 5-tuple (preventing cleanup of the pending state). (Jon Siwek)

  * Updates to httpmonitor and mimestats documentation. (Jeannette Dopheide)

  * Updates to Logs and Cluster documentation (Jeannette Dopheide)

2.2-147 | 2014-02-07 08:06:53 -0800

  * Fix x509-extension test sometimes failing. (Johanna Amann)

2.2-144 | 2014-02-06 20:31:18 -0800

  * Fixing bug in POP3 analyzer. With certain input the analyzer could
    end up trying to write to non-writable memory. (Robin Sommer)

2.2-140 | 2014-02-06 17:58:04 -0800

  * Fixing memory leaks in input framework. (Robin Sommer)

  * Add script to detect filtered TCP traces. Addresses BIT-1119. (Jon

2.2-135 | 2014-01-31 11:09:36 -0800

  * Added some grammar and spelling corrections to Installation and
    Quick Start Guide. (Jeannette Dopheide)

2.2-131 | 2014-01-30 16:11:11 -0800

  * Extend file analysis API to allow file ID caching. This allows an
    analyzer to either provide file IDs associated with some file
    content or to cache a file ID that was already determined by
    script-layer logic so that subsequent calls to the file analysis
    interface can bypass costly detours through script-layer.  This
    can yield a decent performance improvement for analyzers that are
    able to take advantage of it and deal with streaming content (like
    HTTP, which has been adapted accordingly). (Jon Siwek)

2.2-128 | 2014-01-30 15:58:47 -0800

  * Add leak test for Exec module. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix file_over_new_connection event to trigger when entire file is
    missed. (Jon Siwek)

  * Improve TCP connection size reporting for half-open connections.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Improve gap reporting in TCP connections that never see data. We
    no longer accomodate SYN/FIN/RST-filtered traces by not reporting
    missing data. The behavior can be reverted by redef'ing
    "detect_filtered_trace". (Jon Siwek)

  * Improve TCP FIN retransmission handling. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-120 | 2014-01-28 10:25:23 -0800

  * Fix and extend x509_extension() event, which now actually returns
    the extension. (Johanna Amann)

    New event signauture:

        event x509_extension(c: connection, is_orig: bool, cert:X509, extension: X509_extension_info)

2.2-117 | 2014-01-23 14:18:19 -0800

    Bonilla/Jon Siwek)

2.2-105 | 2014-01-20 12:16:48 -0800

  * Support GRE tunnel decapsulation, including enhanced GRE headers.
    GRE tunnels are treated just like IP-in-IP tunnels by parsing past
    the GRE header in between the delivery and payload IP packets.
    Addresses BIT-867. (Jon Siwek)

  * Simplify FragReassembler memory management. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-102 | 2014-01-20 12:00:29 -0800

    emails if available. (Justin Azoff)

2.2-100 | 2014-01-20 11:54:58 -0800

  * Fix caching of recently validated SSL certifcates. (Justin Azoff)

2.2-98 | 2014-01-20 11:50:32 -0800

  * For notice suppresion, instead of storing the entire notice in
    Notice::suppressing, just store the time the notice should be
    suppressed until. This saves significant memory but can no longer
    raise end_suppression, which has been removed. (Justin Azoff)

2.2-96 | 2014-01-20 11:41:07 -0800

  * Integrate libmagic 5.16. Bro now now always relies on
    builtin/shipped magic library/database. (Jon Siwek)

  * Bro now requires a CMake 2.8.x, but no longer a pre-installed
    libmagic. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-93 | 2014-01-13 09:16:51 -0800

    Craig Leres. (Robin Sommer)

2.2-91 | 2014-01-13 01:33:28 -0800

    Siwek)

  * Further improve core.when-interpreter-exceptions unit test. (Jon
    Siwek)

2.2-72 | 2013-12-12 07:12:47 -0800

  * Improve the core.when-interpreter-exceptions unit test to prevent

    wrapper. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-68 | 2013-12-09 15:19:37 -0800

  * Several improvements to input framework error handling for more
    robustness and more helpful error messages. Includes tests for
    many cases. (Johanna Amann)

2.2-66 | 2013-12-09 13:54:16 -0800

  * Fix table &default reference counting for record ctor expressions.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Close signature files after done parsing. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix unlikely null ptr deref in broxygen::Manager. (Jon Siwek)

  * FreeBSD build fix addendum: unintended variable shadowing. (Jon
    Siwek)

    w/ platform. (Jon Siwek)

  * Updated software framework to support parsing IE11 user-agent
    strings. (Seth Hall)

  * Fix the irc_reply event for several server message types. (Seth
    Hall)

  * Fix memory leak in input framework. If the input framework was
    used to read event streams and those streams contained records
    with more than one field, not all elements of the threading Values
    were cleaned up. Addresses BIT-1103. (Johanna Amann)

  * Minor Broxygen improvements. Addresses BIT-1098. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-51 | 2013-12-05 07:53:37 -0800

  * Improve a unit test involving 'when' conditionals. (Jon Siwek)

2.2-48 | 2013-12-04 13:45:47 -0800

  * Support omission of string slice low/high indices, BIT-1097.

    Omission of the low index defaults to 0:

        s = "12345"; s[:3] == "123"

    Omission of the high index defaults to length of the string:

        s = "12345"; s[3:] == "45" (Jon Siwek)

  * Tweak to SMTP script to adjust for new string slicing behaviour.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Test updates. (Robin Sommer)

2.2-44 | 2013-12-04 12:41:51 -0800

  * Fix string slice notation. Addresses BIT-1097. (Jon Siwek)

    Slice ranges were not correctly determined for negative indices
    and also off by one in general (included one more element at the
    end of the substring than what actually matched the index range).
    It's now equivalent to Python slice notation.  Accessing a string
    at a single index is also the same as Python except that an
    out-of-range index returns an empty string instead of throwing an
    expection.

2.2-41 | 2013-12-04 12:40:51 -0800

  * Updating tests. (Robin Sommer)

2.2-40 | 2013-12-04 12:16:38 -0800

  * ssl_client_hello() now receives a vector of ciphers, instead of a
    set, to preserve their order. (Johanna Amann)

2.2-38 | 2013-12-04 12:10:54 -0800

  * New script misc/dump-events.bro, along with core support, that
    dumps events Bro is raising in an easily readable form for
    debugging. (Robin Sommer)

  * Prettyfing Describe() for record types. If a record type has a
    name and ODesc is set to short, we now print the name instead of
    the full field list. (Robin Sommer)

2.2-35 | 2013-12-04 10:10:32 -0800

  * Rework the automated script-reference documentation generation
    process, broxygen. Addresses BIT-701 and BIT-751. (Jon Siwek)

    Highlights:

        - Remove --doc-scripts and -Z options to toggle documentation
          mode. The parser is now always instrumented to gather
          documentation from comments of the form "##", "##!", or
          "##<".

        - Raw comments are available at runtime through several BIF
          functions: get_*_comments;

        - Add --broxygen and -X options to toggle generating
          reST-format documentation output, driven by a config file
          argument.

        - Add a "broxygen" Sphinx extension domain, allowing certain
          pieces of documentation to be generated on-the-fly via
          invoking a Bro process. Re-organized/cleaned up the Sphinx
          source tree in doc/ to use this in some places.

    algorithm. (Johanna Amann, Soumya Basu)

    Bro now provides the following BiFs:

2.1-1072 | 2013-08-14 10:28:51 -0700

  * Adding the unified2 analyzer that reads unified2 files from disk,
    turning them into events. (Seth Hall)

  * Fixing intel framework tests. (Seth Hall)

    intel http handling. (Seth Hall)

2.1-1052 | 2013-08-12 14:38:14 -0700

  * Fixing bug in DNP3 analyzer flagged by compiler warning. (Robin
    Sommer)

2.1-1050 | 2013-08-12 11:37:44 -0700

  * Experimental DNP3 analyzer. This includes only very basic
    script-level support at the moment, but quite a number of events
    are provided. (Hui Lin, Robin Sommer)

2.1-1041 | 2013-08-09 15:32:22 -0700

  * Update coverage baselines for canonical load order of scripts.
    (Jon Siwek)

2.1-1039 | 2013-08-09 15:30:15 -0700

  * Fix mem leak in DHCP analyzer. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix a unit test outdated by recent sumstats changes. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-1036 | 2013-08-05 17:29:11 -0400

  * Fix the SSL infinite loop I just created. (Seth Hall)

2.1-1035 | 2013-08-05 16:44:50 -0400

  * Change to SSL log delay to cause the log to write even if delay times out. (Seth Hall)

2.1-1034 | 2013-08-03 20:27:43 -0700

  * A set of DHCP extensions. (Vlad Grigorescu)

     - Leases are logged to dhcp.log as they are seen.
     - scripts/policy/protocols/dhcp/known-devices-and-hostnames.bro
     - Added DPD sig.

2.1-1027 | 2013-08-03 01:57:37 -0400

  * Fix a major memory issue in the SumStats framework.

2.1-1026 | 2013-08-02 22:35:09 -0400

  * Fix the SumStats top-k plugin and test. (Seth Hall)

  * Rework of SumStats API to reduce high instantaneous memory
    use on clusters. (Seth Hall)

  * Large update for the SumStats framework.

     - On-demand access to sumstats results through "return from"
       functions named SumStats::request and Sumstats::request_key.
       Both functions are tested in standalone and clustered modes.

     - $name field has returned to SumStats which simplifies cluster
       code and makes the on-demand access stuff possible.

     - Clustered results can only be collected for 1 minute from their
       time of creation now instead of time of last read.

     - Thresholds use doubles instead of counts everywhere now.

     - Calculation dependency resolution occurs at start up time now
       instead of doing it at observation time which provide a minor
       cpu performance improvement.  A new plugin registration mechanism
       was created to support this change.

     - AppStats now has a minimal doc string and is broken into hook-based
       plugins.

     - AppStats and traceroute detection added to local.bro (Seth Hall)

2.1-1009 | 2013-08-02 17:19:08 -0700

  * Adding a probabilistic data structure for computing "top k"
    elements. (Johanna Amann)

    The corresponding functions are:

        topk_init(size: count): opaque of topk
        topk_add(handle: opaque of topk, value: any)
        topk_get_top(handle: opaque of topk, k: count)
        topk_count(handle: opaque of topk, value: any): count
        topk_epsilon(handle: opaque of topk, value: any): count
        topk_size(handle: opaque of topk): count
        topk_sum(handle: opaque of topk): count
        topk_merge(handle1: opaque of topk, handle2: opaque of topk)
        topk_merge_prune(handle1: opaque of topk, handle2: opaque of topk)

2.1-971 | 2013-08-01 13:28:32 -0700

  * Fix some build errors. (Jon Siwek)

  * Internal refactoring of how plugin components are tagged/managed.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix various documentation, mostly related to file analysis. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Changing the Bloom filter hashing so that it's independent of
    CompositeHash. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-951 | 2013-08-01 11:19:23 -0400

  * Small fix to deal with a bug in the SSL log delay mechanism.

2.1-948 | 2013-07-31 20:08:28 -0700

  * Fix segfault caused by merging an empty bloom-filter with a
    bloom-filter already containing values. (Johanna Amann)

2.1-945 | 2013-07-30 10:05:10 -0700

  * Make hashers serializable. (Matthias Vallentin)

  * Add docs and use default value for hasher names. (Matthias
    Vallentin)

2.1-939 | 2013-07-29 15:42:38 -0700

  * Added Exec, Dir, and ActiveHTTP modules. (Seth Hall)

    base/utils/exec.bro provides a module to start external processes
    asynchronously and retrieve their output on termination.
    base/utils/dir.bro uses it to monitor a directory for changes, and
    base/utils/active-http.bro for providing an interface for querying
    remote web servers.

2.1-930 | 2013-07-29 15:06:07 -0700

  * Major file analysis overhaul in naming and appearance, along with
    fixes and test updates. (Seth Hall and Jon Siwek)

    Includes:

    * Added protocol description functions that provide a super
      compressed log representation. (Seth Hall)

    * Added mime types to http.log (Seth Hall)

    * Add jar files to the default MHR lookups. (Seth Hall)

    * Adding CAB files for MHR checking. (Seth Hall)

    * Improve malware hash registry script.

        - Include a link to a virustotal search in the notice sub message field.
        - Give all information returned from Team Cymru in the notice message.
        - Add more file types to match on to the default set.

    * Make the custom libmagic database a git submodule.

    * Add an is_orig parameter to file_over_new_connection event.

    * Recorrected the module name to Files.

    * Added Files::analyzer_name to get a more readable name for a
      file analyzer.

    * Improved and just overall better handled multipart mime
      transfers in HTTP and SMTP.  HTTP now has orig_fuids and
      resp_fuids log fields since multiple "files" can be transferred
      with multipart mime in a single request/response pair.  SMTP has
      an fuids field which has file unique IDs for all parts
      transferred. FTP and IRC have a log field named fuid added
      because only a single file can be transferred per irc and ftp
      log line.

2.1-895 | 2013-07-29 14:07:35 -0700

  * Adding a test for a DNSKEY RR. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-894 | 2013-07-29 16:44:41 -0400

  * Updates for the Intel Framework. (Seth Hall)

      - policy/frameworks/intel/seen is the new location for the
        scripts that push data into the intel framework for checking.

      - The new policy/frameworks/intel/do_notice script adds an
        example mechanism for data driven notices.

      - Remove the Intel insertion after heuristically detecting SSH
        bruteforcing.

      - Intel importing format has changed (refer to docs).

      - All string matching is now case insensitive.

      - SMTP intel script has been updated to extract email
        addresses correctly.

      - Small fix sneaking into the smtp base script to actually
        extract individual email addresses in the To: field
        correctly.


2.1-888 | 2013-07-25 12:02:41 -0700

  * Protection about broken traces with empty pcap headers. (Matt
    Thompson)

2.1-887 | 2013-07-25 11:33:27 -0700

  * Support for Bloom filter. (Matthias Vallentin)

    Bro now provides the following BiFs:

        bloomfilter_basic_init(fp: double, capacity: count, name: string &default=""): opaque of bloomfilter
        bloomfilter_counting_init(k: count, cells: count, max: count, name: string &default=""): opaque of bloomfilter
        bloomfilter_add(bf: opaque of bloomfilter, x: any)
        bloomfilter_lookup(bf: opaque of bloomfilter, x: any): count
        bloomfilter_merge(bf1: opaque of bloomfilter, bf2: opaque of bloomfilter): opaque of bloomfilter
        bloomfilter_clear(bf: opaque of bloomfilter)

    Note that currently Bloom filters from separate Bro instances
    (e.g., from different cluster nodes) cannot be merged.

2.1-826 | 2013-07-25 10:12:26 -0700

  * bif files declared with bif_target() are now automatically
    compiled in. No more manual includes to pull them in. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * Covenience make target in testing/btest to update the three
    coverage tests that usually need tweaking when scripts get
    added/removed. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-824 | 2013-07-22 14:25:14 -0400

  * Fixed a scriptland state issue that manifested especially badly on proxies. (Seth Hall)

  * Another test fix. (Robin Sommer)

  * Canonyfying the output of core.print-bpf-filters. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-820 | 2013-07-18 12:30:04 -0700

  * Extending external canonifier to remove fractional values from
    capture_loss.log. (Robin Sommer)

  * Canonifying internal order for plugins and their components to
    make it deterministic. (Robin Sommer)

  * Small raw reader tweaks that got left our earlier. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-814 | 2013-07-15 18:18:20 -0700

  * Fixing raw reader crash when accessing nonexistant file, and
    memory leak when reading from file. Addresses #1038. (Johanna
    Amann)

2.1-811 | 2013-07-14 08:01:54 -0700

  * Bump sqlite to 3.7.17. (Johanna Amann)

  * Small test fixes. (Seth Hall)

  * Fix a bug where the same analyzer tag was reused for two different
    analyzers. (Seth Hall)

  * Moved DPD signatures into script specific directories. Left out
    the BitTorrent signatures pending further updates to that
    analyzer. (Seth Hall)

2.1-802 | 2013-07-10 10:55:14 -0700

  * Const adjustment for methods. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-798 | 2013-07-08 13:05:37 -0700

  * Rewrite of the packet filter framework. (Seth Hall)

    This includes:

    - Plugin interface for adding filtering mechanisms.

    - Integrated the packet filter framework with the analyzer
      framework to retrieve well-known ports from there.

    - Support for BPF-based load balancing (IPv4 and IPv6).  This will
      tie in with upcoming BroControl support for configuring this.

    - Support for BPF-based connection sampling.

    - Support for "shunting" traffic with BPF filters.

    - Replaced PacketFilter::all_packets with
      PacketFilter::enable_auto_protocol_capture_filters.

2.1-784 | 2013-07-04 22:28:48 -0400

  * Add a call to lookup_connection in SSH scripts to update connval. (Seth Hall)

  * Updating submodule(s). (Robin Sommer)

2.1-782 | 2013-07-03 17:00:39 -0700

  * Remove the SSL log queueing mechanism that was included with the
    log delay mechanism. (Seth Hall)

2.1-780 | 2013-07-03 16:46:26 -0700

  * Rewrite of the RAW input reader for improved robustness and new
    features. (Johanna Amann) This includes:

        - Send "end_of_data" event for all kind of streams.
        - Send "process_finished" event with exit code of child
          process at process termination.
        - Expose name of input stream to readers.
        - Better error handling.
        - New "force_kill" option which SIGKILLs processes on reader termination.
        - Supports reading from stdout and stderr simultaneously.
        - Support sending data to stdin of child process.
        - Streaming reads from external commands work without blocking.

2.1-762 | 2013-07-03 16:33:22 -0700

  * Fix to correct support for TLS 1.2. Addresses #1020. (Seth Hall,
    with help from Rafal Lesniak).

2.1-760 | 2013-07-03 16:31:36 -0700

  * Teach broxygen to generate protocol analyzer plugin reference.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Adding 'const' to a number of C++ methods. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-757 | 2013-07-03 16:28:10 -0700

  * Fix redef of table index from clearing table.

    `redef foo["x"] = 1` now acts like `redef foo += { ["x"] = 1 }`
    instead of `redef foo = { ["x"] = 1 }`.

    Addresses #1013. (Jon Siwek)


2.1-755 | 2013-07-03 16:22:43 -0700

  * Add a general file analysis overview/how-to document. (Jon Siwek)

  * Improve file analysis doxygen comments. (Jon Siwek)

  * Improve tracking of HTTP file extraction. http.log now has files
    taken from request and response bodies in different fields for
    each, and can now track multiple files per body. That is, the
    "extraction_file" field is now "extracted_request_files" and
    "extracted_response_files". Addresses #988. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix HTTP multipart body file analysis. Each part now gets assigned
    a different file handle/id. (Jon Siwek)

  * Remove logging of analyzers field of FileAnalysis::Info. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Remove extraction counter in default file extraction scripts. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Remove FileAnalysis::postpone_timeout.
    FileAnalysis::set_timeout_interval can now perform same function.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Make default get_file_handle handlers &priority=5 so they're
    easier to override. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add input interface to forward data for file analysis. The new
    Input::add_analysis function is used to automatically forward
    input data on to the file analysis framework. (Jon Siwek)

  * File analysis framework interface simplifications. (Jon Siwek)

    - Remove script-layer data input interface (will be managed directly
      by input framework later).

    - Only track files internally by file id hash.  Chance of collision
      too small to justify also tracking unique file string.


2.1-741 | 2013-06-07 17:28:50 -0700

  * Fixing typo that could cause an assertion to falsely trigger.
    (Robin Sommer)

2.1-740 | 2013-06-07 16:37:32 -0700

  * Fix for CMake 2.6.x. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-738 | 2013-06-07 08:38:13 -0700

  * Remove invalid free on non-allocated pointer in hash function
    object. Addresses #1018. (Matthias Vallentin)

2.1-736 | 2013-06-06 10:05:20 -0700

  * New "magic constants" @DIR and @FILENAME that expand to the
    directory path of the current script and just the script file name
    without path, respectively. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-731 | 2013-06-04 21:19:08 -0700

  * Reorginization of internal protocol analyzer code. We're moving
    them to a modularized structure, based on a plugin model. Along
    with this change comes generic plugin infrastructure that we'll
    later extend to other Bro component as well. For now all plugins
    are compiled in statically, but in the future we plan to also
    enable dynamic loading at run time. (Robin Sommer)

  * Ignoring file ids in external tests. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-675 | 2013-06-02 20:03:19 -0700

  * Fix a compiler warning. (Robin Sommer)

  * Allow named vector/set/table/record constructors. Addresses #983.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Adding Makefile target test-all that also runs the BroControl test
    suite.  (Robin Sommer)

2.1-664 | 2013-05-28 21:37:46 -0700

  * Dangling pointer fix. Addresses #1004. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-659 | 2013-05-24 17:24:18 -0700

  * Fix broken/missing documentation. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixing test that would fail without ES/curl support. (Robin
    Sommer)

2.1-656 | 2013-05-17 15:58:07 -0700

  * Fix mutex lock problem for writers. (Johanna Amann)

2.1-654 | 2013-05-17 13:49:52 -0700

  * Tweaks to sqlite3 configuration to address threading issues.
    (Johanna Amann)

2.1-651 | 2013-05-17 13:37:16 -0700

  * Fix uninitialized DPM member. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix issue with transaction ID reuse in a single DNS connection. (Seth Hall)

  * New function added to the queue.bro script to support peeking at
    the new gettable item in the queue without removing it. (Seth Hall)

2.1-647 | 2013-05-17 07:47:14 -0700

  * Fixing Broxygen generation to have BROMAGIC set. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix for 'fchmod undeclared here' on FreeBSD. (Robin Sommer)

  * CMake policy fix to avoid errors with older versions. (Robin
    Sommer)

2.1-641 | 2013-05-15 18:15:09 -0700

  * Test update. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-640 | 2013-05-15 17:24:09 -0700

  * Support for cleaning up threads that have terminated. (Johanna
    Amann and Robin Sommer). Includes:

      - Both logging and input frameworks now clean up threads once
        they aren't further needed anymnore.

      - New function Log::remove_stream() that removes a logging
        stream, stopping all writer threads that are associated with
        it. Note, however, that removing a *filter* from a stream
        still doesn't clean up any threads. The problem is that
        because of the output paths potentially being created
        dynamically it's unclear if the writer thread will still be
        needed in the future.

2.1-626 | 2013-05-15 16:09:31 -0700

  * Add "reservoir" sampler for SumStats framework. This maintains
    a set of N uniquely distributed random samples. (Johanna Amann)

2.1-619 | 2013-05-15 16:01:42 -0700

  * SQLite reader and writer combo. This allows to read/write
    persistent data from on disk SQLite databases. The current
    interface is quite low-level, we'll add higher-level abstractions
    in the future. (Johanna Amann)

2.1-576 | 2013-05-15 14:29:09 -0700

  * Initial version of new file analysis framework. This moves most of
    the processing of file content from script-land into the core,
    where it belongs. Much of this is an internal change, and at this
    point the new code has essentially feature-equality with the old
    one. More script-level changes to come. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-502 | 2013-05-10 19:29:37 -0700

  * Allow default function/hook/event parameters. Addresses #972. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Change the endianness parameter of bytestring_to_count() BIF to
    default to false (big endian). (Jon Siwek)

2.1-500 | 2013-05-10 19:22:24 -0700

  * Fix to prevent merge-hook of SumStat's unique plugin from damaging
    source data. (Johanna Amann)

2.1-498 | 2013-05-03 17:44:08 -0700

  * Table lookups return copy of non-const &default vals. This
    prevents unintentional modifications to the &default value itself.
    Addresses #981.  (Jon Siwek)

2.1-496 | 2013-05-03 15:54:47 -0700

  * Fix memory leak and unnecessary allocations in OpaqueVal.
    Addresses #986. (Matthias Vallentin)

2.1-492 | 2013-05-02 12:46:26 -0700

  * Work-around for sumstats framework not propagating updates after
    intermediate check in cluster environments. (Johanna Amann)

  * Always apply tcp_connection_attempt. Before this change it was
    only applied when a connection_attempt() event handler was
    defined. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixing coverage.bare-mode-errors test. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-487 | 2013-05-01 18:03:22 -0700

  * Always apply tcp_connection_attempt timer, even if no
    connection_attempt() event handler is defined. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-486 | 2013-05-01 15:28:45 -0700

  * New framework for computing summary statistics in
    base/framework/sumstats. This replaces the metrics frameworks, and
    comes with a number of applications build on top, see NEWS. More
    documentation to follow. (Seth Hall)

2.1-397 | 2013-04-29 21:19:00 -0700

  * Fixing memory leaks in CompHash implementation. Addresses #987.
    (Robin Sommer)

2.1-394 | 2013-04-27 15:02:31 -0700

    #974. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix record coercion for default inner record fields. Addresses
    #973. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add bytestring_to_count function to bro.bif. Addresses #968. (Yun
    Zheng Hu)

2.1-386 | 2013-03-22 12:41:50 -0700

  * Added reverse() function to strings.bif. (Yun Zheng Hu)

2.1-384 | 2013-03-22 12:10:14 -0700

  * Fix record constructors in table initializer indices.  Addresses
    #660. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-382 | 2013-03-22 12:01:34 -0700

  * Add support for 802.1ah (Q-in-Q). Addresses #641. (Seth Hall)

2.1-380 | 2013-03-18 12:18:10 -0700

  * Fix gcc compile warnings in base64 encoder and benchmark reader.
    (Johanna Amann)

2.1-377 | 2013-03-17 17:36:09 -0700

  * Fixing potential leak in DNS error case. (Vlad Grigorescu)

2.1-375 | 2013-03-17 13:14:26 -0700

  * Add base64 encoding functionality, including new BiFs
	encode_base64() and encode_base64_custom(). (Johanna Amann)

  * Replace call to external "openssl" in extract-certs-pem.bro with
	that encode_base64(). (Johanna Amann)

  * Adding a test for extract-certs-pem.pem. (Robin Sommer)

  * Renaming Base64Decoder to Base64Converter. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-366 | 2013-03-17 12:35:59 -0700

  * Correctly handle DNS lookups for software version ranges. (Seth
    Hall)

  * Improvements to vulnerable software detection. (Seth Hall)

     - Add a DNS based updating method.  This needs to be tested
       still.

     - Vulnerable version ranges are used now instead of only single
       versions.  This can deal with software with multiple stable
       major versions.

  * Update software version parsing and comparison to account for a
    third numeric subversion. Also, $addl is now compared numerically
    if the value is actually numeric. (Seth Hall)

2.1-361 | 2013-03-13 07:18:22 -0700

  * Add check for truncated link frames. Addresses #962. (Jacob
    Baines)

  * Fix large memory allocation in IP fragment reassembly. Addresses
    #961. (Jacob Baines)

2.1-357 | 2013-03-08 09:18:35 -0800

  * Fix race-condition in table-event test. (Johanna Amann)

  * s/bro-ids.org/bro.org/g. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-353 | 2013-03-07 13:31:37 -0800

  * Fix function type-equivalence requiring same parameter names.
    Addresses #957. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix new/delete mismatch. Addresses #958. (Jacob Baines)

  * Fix compiler warnings. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-347 | 2013-03-06 16:48:44 -0800

  * Remove unused parameter from vector assignment method. (Johanna Amann)

  * Remove the byte_len() and length() bifs. (Johanna Amann)

2.1-342 | 2013-03-06 15:42:52 -0800

  * Moved the Notice::notice event and Notice::policy table to both be
    hooks. See documentation and NEWS for information. (Seth Hall).

2.1-338 | 2013-03-06 15:10:43 -0800

  * Fix init of local sets/vectors via curly brace initializer lists.
    (Jon Siwek)

2.1-336 | 2013-03-06 15:08:06 -0800

  * Fix memory leaks resulting from 'when' and 'return when'
    statements. Addresses #946. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix three bugs with 'when' and 'return when' statements. Addresses
    #946. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-333 | 2013-03-06 14:59:47 -0800

  * Add parsing for GTPv1 extension headers and control messages.  (Jon Siwek)

    This includes:

      - A new generic gtpv1_message() event generated for any GTP
        message type.

      - Specific events for the create/update/delete PDP context
        request/response messages.

    Addresses #934.

2.1-331 | 2013-03-06 14:54:33 -0800

  * Fix possible null pointer dereference in identify_data BIF. Also
    centralized libmagic calls for consistent error handling/output.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix build on OpenBSD 5.2. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-328 | 2013-02-05 01:34:29 -0500

  * New script to query the ICSI Certificate Notary
    (http://notary.icsi.berkeley.edu/) over DNS and add information
    to the SSL log at runtime. (Matthias Vallentin)

  * Add delayed logging to SSL base scripts. (Matthias Vallentin)

2.1-319 | 2013-02-04 09:45:34 -0800

  * Update input tests to use exit_only_after_terminate. (Johanna
    Amann)

  * New option exit_only_after_terminate to prevent Bro from exiting.
    If set, the main loop won't terminate before somebody calls
    terminate(). (Robin Sommer)

2.1-311 | 2013-02-01 08:03:01 -0800

  * Updating submodule(s).

2.1-310 | 2013-01-30 20:09:27 -0800

  * Add an error for record coercions that would orphan a field. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Fixing several scripts where a field in an inlined record was
    never removed after a code refactor. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-307 | 2013-01-25 13:50:57 -0800

  * Fix runaway reference counting bug in record coercion. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix memory leak in some reporter messaging cases. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-304 | 2013-01-23 19:43:27 -0800

  * Making a test portable. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-302 | 2013-01-23 16:17:29 -0800

  * Refactoring ASCII formatting/parsing from loggers/readers into a
    separate AsciiFormatter class. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix uninitialized locals in event/hook handlers from having a
    value. Addresses #932. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add a null value check in CompositeHash::ComputeHash. Addresses
    #930. (Jon Siwek)

  * Change reporter messages to more reliably print to stderr.
    Addressed #930 (and revisits #836). (Jon Siwek)

  * Changing test=suite's btest call to use "-j" instead of "-j 5".
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Require "case" blocks to end with either "break", "return", or a
    new "fallthrough" statement that passes control on to the
    subsequent case. This gives us the best mix of safety,
    readability, and flexibility. Addresses #754. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-279 | 2013-01-18 17:18:22 -0800

  * Revert "Trick for parallelizing input framework unit tests." The
    old way of doing the tests seems more reliable for now. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Fixing variable size issues with http response code in
    ElasticSearch writer. (Gilbert Clark)

  * Removing unused class member. (Robin Sommer)

  * Add opaque type-ignoring for the accept_unsupported_types input
    framework option. (Johanna Amann)

2.1-271 | 2013-01-08 10:18:57 -0800

  * Change substring index notation to use a colon.  String slice
    notation is now written as `s[1:2]`. Addresses #422. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-268 | 2013-01-07 09:43:44 -0800

  * Fix memory leak in OpaqueType::DoUnserialize. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-265 | 2012-12-20 17:38:42 -0800

  * Add array-style index accessor for strings.  Addresses #422. (Jon
    Siwek)

    The index expression can take up to two indices for the start and
    end index of the substring to return (e.g. "mystring[1,3]").
    Negative indices are allowed, with -1 representing the last
    character in the string.  The indexing is not cyclic -- if the
    starting index is >= the length of the string an empty string is
    returned, and if the ending index is >= the length of the string
    then it's interpreted as the last index of the string.  Assigning
    to substrings accessed like this isn't allowed.

2.1-263 | 2012-12-20 16:22:09 -0800

  * Bro's language now has a new set of types "opaque of X". (Matthias
    Vallentin)

    Opaque values can be passed around like other values but they can
    only be manipulated with BiF functions, not with other operators.
    Currently, the following opaque types are supported:

        - opaque of md5
        - opaque of sha1
        - opaque of sha256
        - opaquey of entropy.

    They go along with the corrsponding BiF functions md5_*, sha1_*,
    sha256_*, and entropy_*, respectively. Note that these functions
    have changed their signatures to work with opaques types rather
    than global state as it was before.

2.1-240 | 2012-12-20 15:21:07 -0800

  * Improve error for invalid use of types as values. Addresses #923.
    (Jon Siwek)

2.1-238 | 2012-12-20 15:11:25 -0800

  * Finish implementation of script-layer switch statement. Addresses
    #754. (Jon Siwek)

    They behave like C-style switches except case labels can be
    comprised of multiple literal constants delimited by commas.  Only
    atomic types are allowed for now.  Case label bodies that don't
    execute a "return" or "break" statement will fall through to
    subsequent cases.  A default case label is allowed.

  * Fix a case where c$resp$size is misrepresented.  Addresses #730.
    (Jon Siwek)

2.1-234 | 2012-12-20 12:12:19 -0800

  * Fix return value of hook calls that have no handlers. For this
    case, the return value is always true. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix to_port() BIF for port strings with a port number of zero.
    (Jon Siwek)

2.1-231 | 2012-12-14 14:51:35 -0800

  * Make const variables actually constant. Both local and global
    variables declared with "const" could be modified, but now
    expressions that would modify them generate an error message at
    parse-time. Addresses #922. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-229 | 2012-12-14 14:46:12 -0800

  * Fix memory leak in ASCII reader when encoutering errors in input.
    (Johanna Amann)

  * Improvements for the "bad checksums" detector to make it detect
    bad TCP checksums. (Seth Hall)

2.1-223 | 2012-12-12 14:25:15 -0800

  * Trick for parallelizing input framework unit tests. Instead of
    loading listen.bro to block until files are read, just read a pcap
    file in pseudo-realtime. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix reliability of a unit test that relies on when statements.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Remove unused attributes. (Daniel Thayer)
        - Removed attributes &postprocessor and &match from documentation and source code.
        - Removed undocumented attribute &attr from source code.
        - Removed internal attribute "(&tracked)" from documentation.

2.1-218 | 2012-12-10 14:45:04 -0800

  * Add GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTPv1) decapsulation. This currently
    supports automatic decapsulation of GTP-U packets on UDP port 2152.
    The GTPv1 headers for such tunnels can be inspected by handling
    the "gtpv1_g_pdu_packet" event, which has a parameter of type
    "gtpv1_hdr". Addresses #690. (Jon Siwek; derived from patch by
    Carsten Langer)

  * Change BinPAC exceptions in AYIYA/GTP analyzers to do
    "protocol_violation". (Jon Siwek)

2.1-212 | 2012-12-07 19:42:03 -0800

  * Changing the HTTP parser to accept request methods in alignment
    with the RFC. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-209 | 2012-12-05 16:44:04 -0800

  * Adapting the HTTP request line parsing to only accept methods
    consisting of letters [A-Za-z]. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-207 | 2012-12-05 15:47:32 -0800

  * Reporting warnings if kill/waitpid fail in communication system.
    (Bill Parker)

  * Replace() bzero with memset(). (Bill Parker)

  * Merge remote-tracking branch 'vlad/topic/vladg/http-verbs'

    * vlad/topic/vladg/http-verbs:
      A test for HTTP methods, including some horribly illegal requests.
      Remove hardcoded HTTP verbs from the analyzer (#741)

    I added a "bad_HTTP_request" weird for HTTP request lines that don't
    have more than a single word.

    Closes #741. (Robin Sommer)

  * A test for HTTP methods, including some horribly illegal requests. (Vlad Grigorescu)

  * Remove hardcoded HTTP verbs from the analyzer (#741) (Vlad Grigorescu)


2.1-203 | 2012-12-05 14:36:56 -0800

  * Fix segfault: Synchronization of state between connecting peers
    now skips over identifiers that aren't initialized with a value
    yet. Addresses #66. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix segfault: Delete correct entry in error case in input
    framework. (Johanna Amann)

  * Bad record constructor initializers now give an error. Addresses
    #34. (Jon Siwek)

  * Invalid vector indices now generate error message. Addresses #24.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Bump CPack RPM package requirement to Python >= 2.6.0. (Jon Siwek)

  * Interpreter exceptions occurring in "when" blocks are now handled.
    Addresses #779 (Jon Siwek)

2.1-195 | 2012-12-03 14:50:33 -0800

  * Catching out-of-memory in patricia tree code. (Bill Parker)

2.1-194 | 2012-12-03 14:36:26 -0800

  * Renaming ASCII writer filter option 'only_single_header_row' to
    'tsv'. Also clarifying usage. Closes #912. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-193 | 2012-12-03 14:11:14 -0800

  * Fix a set of bugs with table/set attributes. (Jon Siwek)

    - Identifiers that are initialized with set()/table() constructor
      expressions now inherit attributes from the expression.  Before,
      statements like

         const i: set[string] = set() &redef;

      associated the attribute with the set() constructor, but not the
      "i" identifier, preventing redefinition.  Addresses #866.

    - Allow &default attribute to apply to tables initialized as empty
      (via either "{ }" or "table()") or if the expression supplied to it
      can evaluate to a type that's promotable to the same yield type as
      the table.

2.1-191 | 2012-12-03 14:08:56 -0800

  * Add test of record() constructor to table initializer unit test.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix table(), set(), vector() constructors in table initializer
    lists. Also adds type checking of yield values to table()
    constructor and fixes the type checking of yield values in
    vector() constructor. Addresses #5. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-188 | 2012-12-03 14:04:29 -0800

  * Hook functions now callable with "hook" expression (i.e., hook is
    no longer a statement). The return value of the call is an
    implicit boolean value of T if all hook handlers ran, or F if one
    hook handler exited as a result of a break statement and
    potentially prevented other handlers from running.

    Scripts don't need to declare hooks with an explicit return type of bool
    (internally, that's assumed), and any values given to (optional) return
    statements in handler definitions are just ignored.

    Addresses #918. (Jon Siwek)

  * Clarification in hook documentation. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-184 | 2012-12-03 13:59:50 -0800

  * Slightly fix up file name extraction from Content-Disposition
    headers. (Seth Hall)

  * Adding -b flag to bro in unit tests so they run faster.

  * Fixed a DNS attribute issue. Reported by Matt Thompson. (Seth
    Hall)

  * Adding NEWS placeholder for hooks and CSV mode. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-178 | 2012-11-23 19:35:32 -0800

  * The ASCII writer now supports a new filter config option
    "only_single_header_row" that turns the output into CSV format
    when set to "T". (Carsten Langer)

  * Add new function flavor called a "hook". This new flavor of
    function behaves like a "synchronous event". See
    doc/scripts/builtins.rst more details on usage. (Jon Siwek)

  * Improve auto-generated enum documentation. The names of enum types
    are tracked so that variables holding a value of a given enum type
    can generate a reference to it instead of just listing the type as
    a generic "enum". (Jon Siwek)

2.1-171 | 2012-11-23 18:24:15 -0800

  * Fix ambiguity between composite table index and record ctor
    expressions. If a table type is "global t = table[conn_id, bool]
    of count", then checking membership like "[c$id, is_orig] in t"
    now works. Addresses #80. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-169 | 2012-11-23 18:21:32 -0800

  * Fix some warnings from sphinx when building docs. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-167 | 2012-11-14 13:19:17 -0800

  * Add a new BIF "bytestring_to_double" for converting from a binary
    representation of a double. Addresses #908. (Carsten Langer/Daniel
    Thayer)

2.1-162 | 2012-11-13 17:29:00 -0800

  * Fix modbus register array parsing. (Jon Siwek)

  * Adjustments to modbus test cases. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-157 | 2012-11-08 16:22:00 -0800

  * Fix for lookup_hostname BIF. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix for modbus test portability. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-152 | 2012-11-05 16:52:34 -0800

  * Initial version of a completely reworked intelligence framework.
    See doc/intel.rst for more information. (Seth Hall)

  * Experimental Modbus analyzer. See policy/protocols/modbus/* for
    example policies. (Dina Hadziosmanovic, Seth Hall)

2.1-112 | 2012-11-05 13:58:20 -0800

  * New base script for detecting cases of checksum offloading.
    Reporter messages will now tell if one has bad checksums. (Seth
    Hall)

  * Clarifying ownership rules for BroString constructors. (Robin
    Sommer)

2.1-109 | 2012-11-05 13:39:34 -0800

  * Add detection rate threshold for MHR. (Vlad Grigorescu)

  * lookup_hostname_txt fixes. (Vlad Grigorescu)

2.1-104 | 2012-11-01 10:37:50 -0700

  * A new built-in function lookup_hostname_txt() provides support for
    DNS TXT queries. (Vlad Grigorescu)

2.1-101 | 2012-10-31 14:30:26 -0700

  * Documentation reorg: The install info has been consolidated into a
    single document (INSTALL), the upgrade info has been moved from
    the FAQ to a section in the install doc, and the "upgrading from
    1.5 to 2.0" document has been updated (and renamed) to also
    include 2.0 to 2.1 upgrade info. (Daniel Thayer)

2.1-96 | 2012-10-31 14:23:50 -0700

  * Renaming option defining the frequency of alarm summary mails to
    'Logging::default_alarm_mail_interval'. (Daniel Thayer)

2.1-91 | 2012-10-24 16:04:47 -0700

  * Adding PPPoE support to Bro. (Seth Hall)

2.1-87 | 2012-10-24 15:40:06 -0700

  * Adding missing &redef for some TCP options. Addresses #905, #906,
    #907. (Carsten Langer)

2.1-86 | 2012-10-24 15:37:11 -0700

  * Add parsing rules for IPv4/IPv6 subnet literal constants.
    Addresses #888. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-84 | 2012-10-19 15:12:56 -0700

  * Added a BiF strptime() to wrap the corresponding C function. (Seth
    Hall)

2.1-82 | 2012-10-19 15:05:40 -0700

  * Add IPv6 support to signature header conditions. (Jon Siwek)

    - "src-ip" and "dst-ip" conditions can now use IPv6 addresses/subnets.
      They must be written in colon-hexadecimal representation and enclosed
      in square brackets (e.g. [fe80::1]).  Addresses #774.

    - "icmp6" is now a valid protocol for use with "ip-proto" and "header"
      conditions.  This allows signatures to be written that can match
      against ICMPv6 payloads.  Addresses #880.

    - "ip6" is now a valid protocol for use with the "header" condition.
      (also the "ip-proto" condition, but it results in a no-op in that
      case since signatures apply only to the inner-most IP packet when
      packets are tunneled).  This allows signatures to match specifically
      against IPv6 packets (whereas "ip" only matches against IPv4 packets).

    - "ip-proto" conditions can now match against IPv6 packets.  Before,
      IPv6 packets were just silently ignored which meant DPD based on
      signatures did not function for IPv6 -- protocol analyzers would only
      get attached to a connection over IPv6 based on the well-known ports
      set in the "dpd_config" table.

2.1-80 | 2012-10-19 14:48:42 -0700

  * Change how "gridftp" gets added to service field of connection
    records. In addition to checking for a finished SSL handshake over
    an FTP connection, it now also requires that the SSL handshake
    occurs after the FTP client requested AUTH GSSAPI, more
    specifically identifying the characteristics of GridFTP control
    channels. Addresses #891. (Jon Siwek)

  * Allow faster rebuilds in certain cases. Previously, when
    rebuilding with a different "--prefix" or "--scriptdir", all Bro
    source files were recompiled.  With this change, only util.cc is
    recompiled. (Daniel Thayer)

2.1-76 | 2012-10-12 10:32:39 -0700

  * Add support for recognizing GridFTP connections as an extension to
    the standard FTP analyzer. (Jon Siwek)

    This is enabled by default and includes:

      - An analyzer for GSI mechanism of GSSAPI FTP AUTH method. GSI
        authentication involves an encoded TLS/SSL handshake over the
        FTP control session. For FTP sessions that attempt GSI
        authentication, the *service* field of the connection log will
        include "gridftp" (as well as also "ftp" and "ssl").

      - Add an example of a GridFTP data channel detection script. It
        relies on the heuristics of GridFTP data channels commonly
        default to SSL mutual authentication with a NULL bulk cipher
        and that they usually transfer large datasets (default
        threshold of script is 1 GB).  The script also defaults to
        skip_further_processing() after detection to try to save
        cycles analyzing the large, benign connection.

        For identified GridFTP data channels, the *services* fields of
        the connection log will include "gridftp-data".

  * Add *client_subject* and *client_issuer_subject* as &log'd fields
    to SSL::Info record.  Also add *client_cert* and
    *client_cert_chain* fields to track client cert chain. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add a script in base/protocols/conn/polling that generalizes the
    process of polling a connection for interesting features. The
    GridFTP data channel detection script depends on it to monitor
    bytes transferred. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-68 | 2012-10-12 09:46:41 -0700

  * Rename the Input Framework's update_finished event to end_of_data.
    It will now not only fire after table-reads have been completed,
    but also after the last event of a whole-file-read (or
    whole-db-read, etc.). (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix for DNS log problem when a DNS response is seen with 0 RRs.
    (Seth Hall)

2.1-64 | 2012-10-12 09:36:41 -0700

  * Teach --disable-dataseries/--disable-elasticsearch to ./configure.
    Addresses #877. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add --with-curl option to ./configure. Addresses #877. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-61 | 2012-10-12 09:32:48 -0700

  * Fix bug in the input framework: the config table did not work.
    (Johanna Amann)

2.1-58 | 2012-10-08 10:10:09 -0700

  * Fix a problem with non-manager cluster nodes applying
    Notice::policy. This could, for example, result in duplicate
    emails being sent if Notice::emailed_types is redef'd in local.bro
    (or any script that gets loaded on all cluster nodes). (Jon Siwek)

2.1-56 | 2012-10-03 16:04:52 -0700

  * Add general FAQ entry about upgrading Bro. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-53 | 2012-10-03 16:00:40 -0700

  * Add new Tunnel::delay_teredo_confirmation option that indicates
    that the Teredo analyzer should wait until it sees both sides of a
    connection using a valid Teredo encapsulation before issuing a
    protocol_confirmation. Default is on. Addresses #890. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-50 | 2012-10-02 12:06:08 -0700

  * Fix a typing issue that prevented the ElasticSearch timeout to
    work. (Matthias Vallentin)

  * Use second granularity for ElasticSearch timeouts. (Matthias
    Vallentin)

  * Fix compile issues with older versions of libcurl, which don't
    offer *_MS timeout constants. (Matthias Vallentin)

2.1-47 | 2012-10-02 11:59:29 -0700

  * Fix for the input framework: BroStrings were constructed without a
    final \0, which makes them unusable by basically all internal
    functions (like to_count). (Johanna Amann)

  * Remove deprecated script functionality (see NEWS for details).
    (Daniel Thayer)

2.1-39 | 2012-09-29 14:09:16 -0700

  * Reliability adjustments to istate tests with network
    communication. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-37 | 2012-09-25 14:21:37 -0700

  * Reenable some tests that previously would cause Bro to exit with
    an error. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix parsing of large integers on 32-bit systems. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Serialize language.when unit test with the "comm" group. (Jon
    Siwek)

2.1-32 | 2012-09-24 16:24:34 -0700

2.1-26 | 2012-09-23 08:46:03 -0700

  * Add an item to FAQ page about broctl options. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Add more language tests. We now have tests of all built-in Bro
    data types (including different representations of constant
    values, and max./min. values), keywords, and operators (including
    special properties of certain operators, such as short-circuit
    evaluation and associativity). (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix construction of ip6_ah (Authentication Header) record values.

    Authentication Headers with a Payload Len field set to zero would
    cause a crash due to invalid memory allocation because the
    previous code assumed Payload Len would always be great enough to
    contain all mandatory fields of the header. (Jon Siwek)

  * Update compile/dependency docs for OS X. (Jon Siwek)

  * Adjusting Mac binary packaging script. Setting CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
    helps link against standard system libs instead of ones that come
    from other package manager (e.g. MacPorts). (Jon Siwek)

  * Adjusting some unit tests that do cluster communication. (Jon Siwek)

  * Small change to non-blocking DNS initialization. (Jon Siwek)

  * Reorder a few statements in scan.l to make 1.5msecs etc work.
    Adresses #872. (Johanna Amann)

2.1-6 | 2012-09-06 23:23:14 -0700

  * Fixed a bug where "a -= b" (both operands are intervals) was not
    allowed in Bro scripts (although "a = a - b" is allowed). (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Fixed a bug where the "!=" operator with subnet operands was
    treated the same as the "==" operator. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Add sleeps to configuration_update test for better reliability.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix a segfault when iterating over a set when using malformed
    index. (Daniel Thayer)

2.1 | 2012-08-28 16:46:42 -0700

  * Make bif.identify_magic robust against FreeBSD's libmagic config.
    (Robin Sommer)

  * Remove automatic use of gperftools on non-Linux systems.
    --enable-perftools must now explicity be supplied to ./configure
    on non-Linux systems to link against the tcmalloc library.

  * Fix uninitialized value for 'is_partial' in TCP analyzer. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Parse 64-bit consts in Bro scripts correctly. (Johanna Amann)

  * Output 64-bit counts correctly on 32-bit machines (Johanna Amann)

  * Input framework fixes, including:  (Johanna Amann)

    - One of the change events got the wrong parameters.

    - Escape commas in sets and vectors that were unescaped before
      tokenization.

    - Handling of zero-length-strings as last element in a set was
      broken (sets ending with a ,).

    - Hashing of lines just containing zero-length-strings was broken.

    - Make set_separators different from , work for input framework.

    - Input framework was not handling counts and ints out of
      32-bit-range correctly.

    - Errors in single lines do not kill processing, but simply ignore
      the line, log it, and continue.

  * Update documentation for builtin types. (Daniel Thayer)

    - Add missing description of interval "msec" unit.

    - Improved description of pattern by clarifying the issue of
      operand order and difference between exact and embedded
      matching.

  * Documentation fixes for signature 'eval' conditions. (Jon Siwek)

  * Remove orphaned 1.5 unit tests. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add type checking for signature 'eval' condition functions. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Adding an identifier to the SMTP blocklist notices for duplicate
    suppression. (Seth Hall)

2.1-beta-45 | 2012-08-22 16:11:10 -0700

  * Add an option to the input framework that allows the user to chose
    to not die upon encountering files/functions. (Johanna Amann)

2.1-beta-41 | 2012-08-22 16:05:21 -0700

  * Add test serialization to "leak" unit tests that use
    communication. (Jon Siwek)

  * Change to metrics/basic-cluster unit test for reliability. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Fixed ack tracking which could overflow quickly in some
    situations. (Seth Hall)

  * Minor tweak to coverage.bare-mode-errors unit test to work with a
    symlinked 'scripts' dir. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-beta-35 | 2012-08-22 08:44:52 -0700

  * Add testcase for input framework reading sets (rather than
    tables). (Johanna Amann)

2.1-beta-31 | 2012-08-21 15:46:05 -0700

  * Tweak to rotate-custom.bro unit test. (Jon Siwek)

  * Ignore small mem leak every rotation interval for dataseries logs.
    (Jon Siwek)

2.1-beta-28 | 2012-08-21 08:32:42 -0700

  * Linking ES docs into logging document. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-beta-27 | 2012-08-20 20:06:20 -0700

  * Add the Stream record to Log:active_streams to make more dynamic
    logging possible. (Seth Hall)

  * Fix portability of printing to files returned by
    open("/dev/stderr"). (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix mime type diff canonifier to also skip mime_desc columns. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Unit test tweaks/fixes. (Jon Siwek)

    - Some baselines for tests in "leaks" group were outdated.

    - Changed a few of the cluster/communication tests to terminate
      more explicitly instead of relying on btest-bg-wait to kill
      processes.  This makes the tests finish faster in the success case
      and makes the reason for failing clearer in the that case.

  * Fix memory leak of serialized IDs when compiled with
    --enable-debug. (Jon Siwek)

2.1-beta-21 | 2012-08-16 11:48:56 -0700

  * Installing a handler for running out of memory in "new". Bro will
    now print an error message in that case rather than abort with an
    uncaught exception. (Robin Sommer)

2.1-beta-20 | 2012-08-16 11:43:31 -0700

  * Fixed potential problems with ElasticSearch output plugin. (Seth
    Hall)

    if ES server is unset. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-902 | 2012-07-27 12:42:13 -0700

  * New variable in logging framework Log::active_streams to indicate
    Log:ID enums which are currently active. (Seth Hall)

    Sommer)

2.0-898 | 2012-07-27 12:22:03 -0700

  * Small (potential performance) improvement for logging framework. (Seth Hall)

  * Script-level rotation postprocessor fix. This fixes a problem with
    writers that don't have a postprocessor. (Seth Hall)

  * Update input framework documentation to reflect want_record
    change. (Johanna Amann)

  * Fix crash when encountering an InterpreterException in a predicate
    in logging or input Framework. (Johanna Amann)

  * Input framework: Make want_record=T the default for events
    (Johanna Amann)

  * Changing the start/end markers in logs to open/close now
    reflecting wall clock. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-891 | 2012-07-26 17:15:10 -0700

  * Reader/writer API: preventing plugins from receiving further
    messages after a failure. (Robin Sommer)

  * New test for input framework that fails to find a file. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * Improving error handling for threads. (Robin Sommer)

  * Tweaking the custom-rotate test to produce stable output. (Robin
    Sommer)

2.0-884 | 2012-07-26 14:33:21 -0700

  * Add comprehensive error handling for close() calls. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add more test cases for input framework. (Johanna Amann)

  * Input framework: make error output for non-matching event types
    much more verbose. (Johanna Amann)

2.0-877 | 2012-07-25 17:20:34 -0700

  * Fix double close() in FilerSerializer class. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix build warnings. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fixes to ElasticSearch plugin to make libcurl handle http
    responses correctly. (Seth Hall)

  * Fixing FreeBSD compiler error. (Robin Sommer)

  * Silencing compiler warnings. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-871 | 2012-07-25 13:08:00 -0700

  * Fix complaint from valgrind about uninitialized memory usage. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Fix differing log filters of streams from writing to same
    writer/path (which now produces a warning, but is otherwise
    skipped for the second). Addresses #842. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix tests and error message for to_double BIF. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Compile fix. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-866 | 2012-07-24 16:02:07 -0700

  * Correct a typo in usage message. (Daniel Thayer)

    permissions after a recent change). (Daniel Thayer)

2.0-862 | 2012-07-24 15:22:52 -0700

  * Fix initialization problem in logging class. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-844 | 2012-07-23 16:20:59 -0700

  * Reworking parts of the internal threading/logging/input APIs for
    thread-safety. (Robin Sommer)

  * Bugfix for SSL version check. (Johanna Amann)

  * Changing a HTTP DPD from port 3138 to 3128. Addresses #857. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * ElasticSearch logging writer. See logging-elasticsearch.rst for
    more information. (Vlad Grigorescu and Seth Hall).

  * Give configure a --disable-perftools option to disable Perftools
    support even if found. (Robin Sommer)

  * The ASCII log writer now includes "#start <timestamp>" and "#end
    <timestamp> lines in the each file. (Robin Sommer)

  * ASCII logs now escape '#' at the beginning of log lines. Addresses
    #763. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix bug, where in dns.log rcode always was set to 0/NOERROR when
    no reply package was seen. (Johanna Amann)

  * Updating to Mozilla's current certificate bundle. (Seth Hall)

2.0-769 | 2012-07-13 16:17:33 -0700

  * Fix some Info:Record field documentation. (Vlad Grigorescu)

  * Fix overrides of TCP_ApplicationAnalyzer::EndpointEOF. (Jon Siwek)

    RefExpr::Eval(Val*) method since it was never called. (Jon Siwek)

  * Remove baselines for some leak-detecting unit tests. (Jon Siwek)

  * Unblock SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGSEGV and SIGBUS for threads, so that
    they now propagate to the main thread. Adresses #848. (Johanna
    Amann)

2.0-761 | 2012-07-12 08:14:38 -0700

  * Some small fixes to further reduce SOCKS false positive logs. (Seth Hall)

  * Calls to pthread_mutex_unlock now log the reason for failures.
    (Johanna Amann)

2.0-757 | 2012-07-11 08:30:19 -0700

  * Fixing memory leak. (Seth Hall)

2.0-755 | 2012-07-10 16:25:16 -0700

    (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix many compiler warnings. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix segfault when there's an error/timeout resolving DNS requests.
    Addresses #846. (Jon Siwek)

  * Remove a non-portable test case. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix typos in input framework doc. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix typos in DataSeries documentation. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Bugfix making custom rotate functions work again. (Robin Sommer)

  * Tiny bugfix for returning writer name. (Robin Sommer)

  * Moving make target update-doc-sources from top-level Makefile to
    btest Makefile. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-733 | 2012-07-02 15:31:24 -0700

  * Extending the input reader DoInit() API. (Johanna Amann). It now
    provides a Info struct similar to what we introduced for log
    writers, including a corresponding "config" key/value table.

  * Fix to make writer-info work when debugging is enabled. (Johanna
    Amann)

2.0-726 | 2012-07-02 15:19:15 -0700

  * Extending the log writer DoInit() API. (Robin Sommer)

    We now pass in a Info struct that contains:

        - the path name (as before)
        - the rotation interval
        - the log_rotate_base_time in seconds
        - a table of key/value pairs with further configuration options.

    To fill the table, log filters have a new field "config: table[string]
    of strings". This gives a way to pass arbitrary values from
    script-land to writers. Interpretation is left up to the writer.

  * Split calc_next_rotate() into two functions, one of which is
    thread-safe and can be used with the log_rotate_base_time value
    from DoInit().

  * Updates to the None writer. (Robin Sommer)

        - It gets its own script writers/none.bro.

        - New bool option LogNone::debug to enable debug output. It then
          prints out all the values passed to DoInit().

        - Fixed a bug that prevented Bro from terminating.

2.0-723 | 2012-07-02 15:02:56 -0700

  * Extract ICMPv6 NDP options and include in ICMP events.  This adds
    a new parameter of type "icmp6_nd_options" to the ICMPv6 neighbor
    discovery events. Addresses #833. (Jon Siwek)

  * Set input frontend type before starting the thread. This means
    that the thread type will be output correctly in the error
    message. (Johanna Amann)

2.0-719 | 2012-07-02 14:49:03 -0700

  * Fix inconsistencies in random number generation. The
    srand()/rand() interface was being intermixed with the
    srandom()/random() one.  The later is now used throughout. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Changed the srand() and rand() BIFs to work deterministically if
    Bro was given a seed file. Addresses #825. (Jon Siwek)

  * Updating input framework unit tests to make them more reliable and
    execute quicker. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixed race condition in writer and reader initializations. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Small tweak to make test complete quicker. (Jon Siwek)

  * Drain events before terminating log/thread managers. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix strict-aliasing warning in RemoteSerializer.cc. Addresses
    #834. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix typos in event documentation. (Daniel Thayer)

2.0-709 | 2012-06-21 10:14:24 -0700

  * Fix exceptions thrown in event handlers preventing others from running. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add another SOCKS command. (Seth Hall)

  * Fixed some problems with the SOCKS analyzer and tests. (Seth Hall)

  * Updating NEWS in preparation for beta. (Robin Sommer)

  * Accepting different AF_INET6 values for loopback link headers.
    (Robin Sommer)

2.0-698 | 2012-06-20 14:30:40 -0700

  * Updates for the SOCKS analyzer (Seth Hall).

    - A SOCKS log!

    - Now supports SOCKSv5 in the analyzer and the DPD sigs.

    - Added protocol violations.

  * Updates to the tunnels framework. (Seth Hall)

    - Make the uid field optional since it's conceptually incorrect
      for proxies being treated as tunnels to have it.

    - Reordered two fields in the log.

    - Reduced the default tunnel expiration interface to something
      more reasonable (1 hour).

  * Make Teredo bubble packet parsing more lenient. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix a crash in NetSessions::ParseIPPacket(). (Jon Siwek)

2.0-690 | 2012-06-18 16:01:33 -0700

  * Support for decapsulating tunnels via the new tunnel framework in
    base/frameworks/tunnels.

    Bro currently supports Teredo, AYIYA, IP-in-IP (both IPv4 and
    IPv6), and SOCKS. For all these, it logs the outher tunnel
    connections in both conn.log and tunnel.log, and proceeds to
    analyze the inner payload as if it were not tunneled, including
    also logging it in conn.log (with a new tunnel_parents column
    pointing back to the outer connection(s)). (Jon Siwek, Seth Hall,
    Gregor Maier)

  * The options "tunnel_port" and "parse_udp_tunnels" have been
    removed. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-623 | 2012-06-15 16:24:52 -0700

  * Changing an error in the input framework to a warning. (Robin
    Sommer)

2.0-622 | 2012-06-15 15:38:43 -0700

  * Input framework updates. (Johanna Amann)

    - Disable streaming reads from executed commands. This lead to
      hanging Bros because pclose apparently can wait for eternity if
      things go wrong.

     - Automatically delete disabled input streams.

     - Documentation.

2.0-614 | 2012-06-15 15:19:49 -0700

  * Remove an old, unused diff canonifier. (Jon Siwek)

  * Improve an error message in ICMP analyzer. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix a warning message when building docs. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix many errors in the event documentation. (Daniel Thayer)

2.0-608 | 2012-06-11 15:59:00 -0700

  * Add more error handling code to logging of enum vals. Addresses
    #829. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-606 | 2012-06-11 15:55:56 -0700

  * Fix summary lines for BIF documentation and corrected the
    description of "fmt" and "floor" BIFs. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix val_size BIF tests and improve docs. (Daniel Thayer)

2.0-602 | 2012-06-07 15:06:19 -0700

  * Include header for usleep(), caused compile failure on Archlinux. (Jon Siwek)

  * Revert "Fixed a bug with the MIME analyzer not removing whitespace
    on wrapped headers." Needs discussion. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-598 | 2012-06-06 11:47:00 -0700

  * Add @load-sigs directive for loading signature files (addresses
    #551). This can be used to load signatures relative to the current
    scripts (e.g., "@load-sigs ./foo.sig"). (Jon Siwek)


2.0-596 | 2012-06-06 11:41:00 -0700

    * Fixes for some BiFs and their documentation. (Daniel Thayer)

    * Many new unit tests for BiFs. (Daniel Thayer)

2.0-579 | 2012-06-06 11:04:46 -0700

  * Memory leak fixes for bad usages of VectorVal ctor. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixed a bug with the MIME analyzer not removing whitespace on
    wrapped headers. (Seth Hall)

  * Change Input::update_finished lookup to happen at init time. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix going through the internal_handler() function which will now
    set the event as "used" (i.e. it's marked as being raised
    somewhere). Addresses #823. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix format specifier on RemoteSerializer::Connect. This caused
    32-bit systems to show a warning at compile-time, and fail when
    connecting to peers. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixes for running tests in parallel. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-571 | 2012-05-30 19:12:43 -0700

  * Updating submodule(s).

2.0-570 | 2012-05-30 19:08:18 -0700

  * A new input framework enables scripts to read in external data
    dynamically on the fly as Bro is processing network traffic.
    (Johanna Amann)

    Currently, the framework supports reading ASCII input that's
    structured similar as Bro's log files as well as raw blobs of
    data. Other formats will come in the future.

    See doc/input.rst for more information (this will be extended
    further soon).

2.0-395 | 2012-05-30 17:03:31 -0700

  * Remove unnecessary assert in ICMP analyzer which could lead to
    aborts. Addresses #822.

  * Improve script debugger backtrace and print commands. (Jon Siwek)

  * Switching default DS compression to gzip. (Robin Sommer)

  * Improve availability of IPv6 flow label in connection records.
    This adds a "flow_label" field to the "endpoint" record type,
    which is used for both the "orig" and "resp" fields of
    "connection" records.  The new "connection_flow_label_changed"
    event also allows tracking of changes in flow labels: it's raised
    each time one direction of the connection starts using a different
    label. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add unit tests for Broccoli SSL and Broccoli IPv6 connectivity.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Remove AI_ADDRCONFIG getaddrinfo hints flag for listening sockets.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Undo unnecessary communication protocol version bump. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add support to Bro for connecting with peers over IPv6. (Jon Siwek)

    - Communication::listen_ipv6 needs to be redef'd to true in order
      for IPv6 listening sockets to be opened.

    - Added Communication::listen_retry option as an interval at which
      to retry binding to socket addresses that were already in use.

    - Added some explicit baselines to check in the istate.events and
      istate.events-ssl tests -- the SSL test was incorrectly passing
      because it compared two empty files.  (The files being empty
      because "http/base" was given as an argument to Bro which it
      couldn't handle because that script doesn't exist anymore).

    - Support for communication over non-global IPv6 addresses. This
      usually requires specifying an additional zone identifier (see
      RFC 4007). The connect() and listen() BIFs have been changed to
      accept this zone identifier as an argument.


2.0-377 | 2012-05-24 16:46:06 -0700

  * Documentation fixes. (Jon Siwek and Daniel Thayer)

2.0-372 | 2012-05-17 13:59:45 -0700

  * Fix compile errors. (Jon Siwek)

  * Linking in the DS docs. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fix mobility checksums unit test. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-367 | 2012-05-17 12:42:30 -0700

  * Adding support for binary output via DataSeries. See
    logging-dataseries.rst for more information. (Gilbert Clark and
    Robin Sommer)

  * Adding target update-doc-sources to top-level Makefile that runs
    genDocSourcesList.sh. (Robin Sommer)

  * Moving trace for rotation test into traces directory. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixing a rotation race condition at termination. (Robin Sommer)

  * Extending log post-processor call to include the name of the
    writer. (Robin Sommer)

  * In threads, an internal error now immediately aborts. Otherwise,
    the error won't make it back to the main thread for a while and
    subsequent code in the thread would still execute. (Robin Sommer)

  * DataSeries cleanup. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixing threads' DoFinish() method. It wasn't called reliably. Now,
    it's always called before the thread is destroyed (assuming
    processing has went normally so far). (Robin Sommer)

2.0-341 | 2012-05-17 09:54:30 -0700

  * Add a comment to explain the ICMPv6 error message types. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Quieting external test output somehwat. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-336 | 2012-05-14 17:15:44 -0700

  * Don't print the various "weird" events to stderr. Address #805.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Generate icmp_error_message event for ICMPv6 error msgs.
    Previously, icmp_sent was being generated, but icmp_error_message
    contains more info.

  * Improved documentation comments for icmp-related events. (Daniel
    Thayer)

2.0-330 | 2012-05-14 17:05:56 -0700

  * Add `addr_to_uri` script-level function that adds brackets to an
    address if it's IPv6 and will be included in a URI or when a
    ":<port>" needs to be appended to it. (Jon Siwek)

  * Also add a test case for content extraction. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix typos and improve INSTALL document. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Switching to new btest command TEST-SERIALIZE for communication
    tests. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-323 | 2012-05-04 21:04:34 -0700

  * Add SHA1 and SHA256 hashing BIFs. Addresses #542.

  * Refactor all internal MD5 stuff to use OpenSSL's. (Jon Siwek)

  * Changes to open-file caching limits and uncached file unserialization. (Jon Siwek)

    - Unserializing files that were previously kicked out of the open-file
      cache would cause them to be fopen'd with the original access
      permissions which is usually 'w' and causes truncation.  They
      are now opened in 'a' mode.  (addresses #780)

    - Add 'max_files_in_cache' script option to manually set the maximum
      amount of opened files to keep cached.  Mainly this just helped
      to create a simple test case for the above change.

    - Remove unused NO_HAVE_SETRLIMIT preprocessor switch.

    - On systems that don't enforce a limit on number of files opened for
      the process, raise default max size of open-file cache from
      32 to 512.

2.0-319 | 2012-05-03 13:24:44 -0700

  * SSL bugfixes and cleanup. (Seth Hall)

    - SSL related files and classes renamed to remove the "binpac" term.

    - A small fix for DPD scripts to make the DPD log more helpful if
      there are multiple continued failures.

    - Fixed the SSL analyzer to make it stop doing repeated violation
      messages for some handshake failures.

    - Added a $issuer_subject to the SSL log.

    - Created a basic test for SSL.

    - Fixed parsing of TLS server extensions. (Seth Hall)

2.0-315 | 2012-05-03 11:44:17 -0700

  * Add two more TLS extension values that we see in live traffic.
    (Johanna Amann)

  * Fixed IPv6 link local unicast CIDR and added IPv6 loopback to
    private address space. (Seth Hall)

  * Fixed a problem where cluster workers were still processing
    notices in some cases. (Seth Hall)

  * Added a configure option to specify the 'etc' directory. Addresses
    #801. (Daniel Thayer)


2.0-306 | 2012-04-24 14:37:00 -0700

  * Add further TLS extension values "extended_random" and
    "heartbeat". (Seth Hall)

  * Fix problem with extracting FTP passwords and add "ftpuser" as
    another anonymous username.  (Seth Hall, discovered by Patrik
    Lundin).

2.0-303 | 2012-04-19 10:01:06 -0700

  * Changes related to ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages. (Jon Siwek)

    - The 'icmp_conn' record now contains an 'hlim' field since hop limit
      in the IP header is an interesting field for at least these ND
      messages.

    - Fixed and extended 'icmp_router_advertisement' event parameters.

    - Changed 'icmp_neighbor_advertisement' event parameters to add
      more of the known boolean flags.

2.0-301 | 2012-04-17 17:58:55 -0700

  * Bro now support ICMPv6. (Matti Mantere, Jon Siwek, Robin Sommer,
	Daniel Thayer).

	Overall, Bro now raises the following ICMP events for v4 and v6 as
	appropiate:

        event icmp_sent(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn);
        event icmp_echo_request(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, id: count, seq: count, payload: string);
        event icmp_echo_reply(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, id: count, seq: count, payload: string);
        event icmp_error_message(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, code: count, context: icmp_context);
        event icmp_unreachable(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, code: count, context: icmp_context);
        event icmp_packet_too_big(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, code: count, context: icmp_context);
        event icmp_time_exceeded(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, code: count, context: icmp_context);
        event icmp_parameter_problem(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, code: count, context: icmp_context);
        event icmp_router_solicitation(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn);
        event icmp_router_advertisement(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, hop_limit: count, managed: bool, router_lifetime: count, reachable_time: interval, retrans_timer: interval);
        event icmp_neighbor_solicitation(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, tgt:addr);
        event icmp_neighbor_advertisement(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, tgt:addr);
        event icmp_redirect(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, tgt: addr, dest: addr);

    The `icmp_conn` record got a new boolean field 'v6' that indicates
    whether the ICMP message is v4 or v6.

    This change also includes further low-level work on existing IP
	and ICMP code, including a reorganization of how ICMPv4 is
	handled.

2.0-281 | 2012-04-17 17:40:39 -0700

  * Small updates for the bittorrent analyzer to support 64bit types
    in binpac. (Seth Hall)

  * Removed the attempt at bittorrent resynchronization. (Seth Hall)

2.0-276 | 2012-04-17 17:35:56 -0700

  * Add more support for <netinet/ip6.h>'s that lack some structure
    definitions. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-273 | 2012-04-16 18:08:56 -0700

  * Removing QR flag from DNS log in response, which should not have
    been there in the first place. (Seth Hall)

  * Sync up patricia.c/h with pysubnettree repo. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Adding missing leak groups to a couple tests. Also activating leak
    checking for proxy in basic-cluster test. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-267 | 2012-04-09 17:47:28 -0700

  * Add support for mobile IPv6 Mobility Header (RFC 6275).  (Jon
    Siwek)

    - Enabled through a new --enable-mobile-ipv6 configure-time
      option. If not enabled, the mobility header (routing type 2) and
      Home Address Destination option are ignored.

    - Accessible at script-layer through 'mobile_ipv6_message' event.

  * Refactor IP_Hdr routing header handling, add MobileIPv6 Home
    Address handling. Packets that use the Home Address Destination
    option use that option's address as the connection's originator.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Revert TCP checksumming to cache common data, like it did before.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Improve handling of IPv6 routing type 0 extension headers. (Jon
    Siwek)

    - flow_weird event with name argument value of "routing0_hdr" is raised
      for packets containing an IPv6 routing type 0 header because this
      type of header is now deprecated according to RFC 5095.

    - Packets with a routing type 0 header and non-zero segments left
      now use the last address in that header in order to associate
      with a connection/flow and for calculating TCP/UDP checksums.

    - Added a set of IPv4/IPv6 TCP/UDP checksum unit tests (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix table expiry for values assigned in bro_init() when reading
    live. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-257 | 2012-04-05 15:32:43 -0700

  * Fix CMake from warning about unused ENABLE_PERFTOOLS_DEBUG
    variable. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix handling of IPv6 atomic fragments. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix that prevents Bro processes that do neither local logging nor
    request remote logs from spawning threads. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixing perftools-debug support. (Robin Sommer)

  * Reverting SocketComm change tuning I/O behaviour. (Robin Sommer)

  * Adding notice_policy.log canonification for external tests. (Robin Sommer)


2.0-245 | 2012-04-04 17:25:20 -0700

  * Internal restructuring of the logging framework: we now spawn
    threads doing the I/O. From a user's perspective not much should
    change, except that the OS may now show a bunch of Bro threads.
    (Gilbert Clark and Robin Sommer).

  * When building Bro, we now always link in tcmalloc if it's found at
    configure time. If it's installed but not picked up,
    --with-perftools may help. (Robin Sommer)

  * Renaming the configure option --enable-perftools to
    --enable-perftool-debug to indicate that the switch is only
    relevant for debugging the heap. It's not needed to pick up
    tcmalloc for better performance. (Robin Sommer)

2.0-184 | 2012-03-28 15:11:11 -0700

  * Improve handling of IPv6 Routing Type 0 headers.  (Jon Siwek)

    - For RH0 headers with non-zero segments left, a
      "routing0_segleft" flow_weird event is raised (with a
      destination indicating the last address in the routing header),
      and an "rh0_segleft" event can also be handled if the other
      contents of the packet header are of interest. No further
      analysis is done as the complexity required to correctly
      identify destination endpoints of connections doesn't seem worth
      it as RH0 has been deprecated by RFC 5095.

    - For RH0 headers without any segments left, a "routing0_header"
      flow_weird event is raised, but further analysis still occurs as
      normal.

2.0-182 | 2012-03-28 15:01:57 -0700

  * Remove dead tcp_checksum function from net_util. (Jon Siwek)

  * Change routing0_data_to_addrs BIF to return vector of addresses.
    The order of addresses in type 0 routing headers is
    interesting/important. (Jon Siwek)


2.0-179 | 2012-03-23 17:43:31 -0700

  * Remove the default "tcp or udp or icmp" filter. In default mode,
    Bro would load the packet filter script framework which installs a
    filter that allows all packets, but in bare mode (the -b option),
    this old filter would not follow IPv6 protocol chains and thus
    filter out packets with extension headers. (Jon Siwek)

  * Update PacketFilter/Discarder code for IP version independence.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix some IPv6 header related bugs. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add IPv6 fragment reassembly. (Jon Siwek)

  * Add handling for IPv6 extension header chains. Addresses #531.
    (Jon Siwek)

    - The script-layer 'pkt_hdr' type is extended with a new 'ip6' field
      representing the full IPv6 header chain.

    - The 'new_packet' event is now raised for IPv6 packets. Addresses
      #523.

    - A new event called 'ipv6_ext_header' is raised for any IPv6
      packet containing extension headers.

    - A new event called 'esp_packet' is raised for any packets using
      ESP ('new_packet' and 'ipv6_ext_header' events provide
      connection info, but that info can't be provided here since the
      upper-layer payload is encrypted).

    - The 'unknown_protocol' weird is now raised more reliably when
      Bro sees a transport protocol or IPv6 extension header it can't
      handle. Addresses #522.

  * Add unit tests for IPv6 fragment reassembly, ipv6_ext_headers and
    esp_packet events. (Jon Siwek)

  * Adapt FreeBSD's inet_ntop implementation for internal use. Now we
    get consistent text representations of IPv6 addresses across
    platforms. (Jon Siwek)

  * Update documentation for new syntax of IPv6 literals. (Jon Siwek)


2.0-150 | 2012-03-13 16:16:22 -0700

  * Changing the regular expression to allow Site::local_nets in
    signatures. (Julien Sentier)

  * Removing a line of dead code. Found by . Closes #786. (Julien
    Sentier)

2.0-146 | 2012-03-13 15:39:38 -0700

  * Change IPv6 literal constant syntax to require encasing square
    brackets. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-145 | 2012-03-09 15:10:35 -0800

  * Remove the match expression. 'match' and 'using' are no longer
    keywords. Addressed #753. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-143 | 2012-03-09 15:07:42 -0800

  * Fix a BRO_PROFILER_FILE/mkstemp portability issue. Addresses #794.
    (Jon Siwek)

2.0-139 | 2012-03-02 09:33:04 -0800

  * Changes to how script coverage integrates with test suites. (Jon Siwek)

    - BRO_PROFILER_FILE now passes .X* templated filenames to mkstemp
      for generating unique coverage state files.

    - Rearranging Makefile targets.  The general rule is that if the
      all/brief target fails out due to a test failure, then the dependent
      coverage target won't run, but can still be invoked directly later.
      (e.g. make brief || make coverage)

  * Standardized on the &default function for SSL constants. (Seth
    Hall)

  * Adding btest group "leaks" to leak tests. (Robin Sommer)

  * A number of smaller memory fixes and code cleanups. (Julien
    Sentier)

  * Add to_subnet bif. Fixes #782). (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix IPAddr::Mask/ReverseMask not allowing argument of 0. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Refactor IPAddr v4 initialization from string. Fixes #775. (Jon Siwek)

  * Parse the dotted address string directly instead of canonicalizing
    and passing to inet_pton. (Jon Siwek)


2.0-108 | 2012-02-24 15:21:07 -0800

  * Refactoring a number of usages of new IPAddr class. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixed a bug in remask_addr bif. (Jon Siwek)

  * GeoIP installation documentation update. (Seth Hall)

  * Decrease strictness of parsing IPv4 strings into addrs. Fixes #775. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix memory leak in DNS manager. Fixes #777. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix IPAddr/IPPrefix serialization bugs. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix compile error. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-86 | 2012-02-17 15:41:06 -0800

  * Changing ARP detection to always kick in even if no analyzer is
    activated. (Robin Sommer)

  * DNS name lookups performed by Bro now also query AAAA records.
    DNS_Mgr handles combining the results of the A and AAAA queries
    for a given hostname such that at the scripting layer, the name
    resolution can yield a set with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. (Jon
    Siwek)

  * Add counts_to_addr and addr_to_counts conversion BIFs. (Jon Siwek)

  * Change HashKey threshold for using H3 to 36 bytes. (Jon Siwek)

  * Remove mention of --enable-brov6 in docs. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Remove --enable-brov6 from configure usage text (Daniel Thayer)

  * Add a test and baseline for addr_to_ptr_name BiF. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Adding a test and baseline for ptr_name_to_addr BiF. (Seth Hall)

  * Fix the ptr_name_to_addr BiF to work with IPv6 (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix a memory leak that perftools now complains about. (Jon Siwek)

  * Remove --enable-brov6 flag, IPv6 now supported by default. (Jon Siwek)

    Some script-layer changes of note:

    - dns_AAAA_reply event signature changed: the string representation
      of an IPv6 addr is easily derived from the addr value, it doesn't
      need to be another parameter.  This event also now generated directly
      by the DNS analyzer instead of being "faked" into a dns_A_reply event.

    - Removed addr_to_count BIF.  It used to return the host-order
      count representation of IPv4 addresses only.  To make it more
      generic, we might later add a BIF to return a vector of counts
      in order to support IPv6.

    - Changed the result of enclosing addr variables in vertical pipes
      (e.g. |my_addr|) to return the bit-width of the address type which
      is 128 for IPv6 and 32 for IPv4.  It used to function the same
      way as addr_to_count mentioned above.

    - Remove bro_has_ipv6 BIF

    Thayer)

2.0-36 | 2012-01-27 10:38:14 -0800

  * New "Brofiler" mode that tracks and records script statements
    executed during runtime. (Jon Siwek)

    Use the BROFILER_FILE environment variable to point to a file in
    which statement usage statistics from Bro script-layer can be
    output.

    Script statements that should be ignored can be marked with a "#
    @no-test" comment. For example:

        print "don't cover"; # @no-test

        if ( F )
            { # @no-test
            ...
            }

  * Integrated coverage measurement into test-suite. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-20 | 2012-01-25 16:34:51 -0800

  * BiF cleanup (Matthias Vallentin)

      - Rename NFS3::mode2string to a more generic file_mode().

      - Unify do_profiling()/make_connection_persistent()/expect_connection()
        to return any (i.e., nothing) instead of bools.

      - Perform type checking on count-to-port conversion. Related to #684.

      - Remove redundant connection_record() BiF. The same
        functionality is provided by lookup_connection().

      - Remove redundant active_connection() BiF. The same
        functionality is provided by connection_exists().

      - exit() now takes the exit code as argument.

      - to_port() now received a string instead of a count.

  * Replace the --snaplen/-l command line option with a
    scripting-layer option called "snaplen" (which can also be
    redefined on the command line, e.g. `bro -i eth0 snaplen=65535`).

  * Reduce snaplen default from 65535 to old default of 8192. Fixes
    #720. (Jon Siwek)

2.0-beta-174 | 2012-01-04 12:47:10 -0800

      load the frameworks/communication/listen script.

    - If encrypted listening is desired set the following:
    	redef Communication::listen_encrypted=T;

  plugins. (Seth Hall)

    - With the software-browser-plugins script you can watch for Omniture
      advertising servers to grab the list of installed plugins.

    - I reorganized the plugin detection a bit too to abstract it better.

    - Removed the WEB_ prefix from all of the Software::Type HTTP enums.
      They were essentially redundant due to the full name already being
      HTTP::SERVER (for example).

      expired, or haven't yet become valid.

    - protocols/ssl/extract-certs-pem is a script for taking certs off
      the line and converting them to PEM certificates with the openssl
      command line tool then dumping them to a file.

  * Notice::type_suppression_intervals: table[Notice::Type] of
    interval can be used to modify the suppression intervals for

1.6-dev-1293 | 2011-09-22 19:44:37 -0700

  * Smaller script tweaks. (Seth Hall)

  * Duplicate notice suppression. (Seth Hall)

    - Duplicate notices are discovered with the new Notice::Info
      field $identifier.  It's a string that is left up to the
      notice implementor to define which would indicate a
      fundamentally duplicate notice.  The field is optional and
      if it's not included it's not possible for notice
      suppression to take place.

    - Duplicate notices are suppressed by default for the interval
      defined by the Notice::default_suppression_interval variable
      (1 hour by default).

    - A new notice action was defined ACTION_NO_SUPPRESS to prevent
      suppression for a specific notice instance.  A convenience set
      named not_suppressed_types was also created to not suppress
      entire notice types.

    - A new field was added to the PolicyItem type to modify the length
      of time a notice should be suppressed if the predicate matches.
      The field is named $suppress_for.  This name makes the code more
      readable like this: $suppress_for = 1day

    - New events were created to give visibility into the notice
      framework's suppression activity.
      - event Notice::begin_suppression(n: Notice::Info)
      - event Notice::suppressed(n: Notice::Info)
      - event Notice::end_suppression(n: Notice::Info)

    - The suppression.bro script doesn't have a baseline because
      it is causing a segfault in Bro.  This one test is the
      reason that this is being integrated into a branch instead
      of master. (Seth Hall)

  * Fix crash on exit. Addresses #607. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix PktSrc setting next_timestamp even when no packet available.
    (Jon Siwek)

        (Seth Hall)

      - HTTP body size measurement added to http.log.

  * A larget set of changes to the testing/external infrastructure.
    The traces for external test-suites are no longer kept inside the
    repositories themselves but downloaded separately via curl. This
    is because git is pretty bad at dealing with large files. See the
    README for more information. (Robin Sommer)

1.6-dev-1061 | 2011-08-08 18:25:27 -0700

  * A set of new/changed tests regarding the new policy script
    organisation. (Robin Sommer)

1.6-dev-1058 | 2011-08-08 16:15:18 -0700

  * Reorganisation of the scripts that Bro loads by default. (Seth
    Hall)

    - policy/ renamed to scripts/

    - By default BROPATH now contains:
    	- scripts/
    	- scripts/policy
    	- scripts/site

    - The scripts in scripts/base/protocols/ only do logging and state
      building.

    - All of scripts/base/ is loaded by by default. This can however
      be disabled by switching Bro into "bare mode" using the new
      command-line option --bare-mode (or -b). The cripts in
      scripts/base/ don't use relative path loading to ease use of
      bare mode (to copy and paste that script).

    - The scripts in scripts/base/frameworks/ add functionality
      without causing any additional overhead.

    - All "detection" activity happens through scripts in
      scripts/policy/.

    - bro.init was renamed to base/init-bare.bro, and base/all.bro was
      renamed to init-default.bro.

    - local.bro now loads more functionality from policy/ and adds
      more documentation. (Seth Hall)

  * Adding default_path_func() to the logging framework that makes the
    default naming scheme script-level controlled. (Robin Sommer)

  * Reworking logging's postprocessor logic so that postprocessor
    commands are no longer run by the log writers themselves, but
    instead by a script level function. (Robin Sommer)

  * The communication subsystem is now by default off and must be
    enabled explicitly with a new BiF, enable_communication(). Closes
    #540. (Robin Sommer)

  * The hostname notice email extension now only add hostnames for
    emailed noticed. (Seth Hall)

  * Cleaning up doc generation. (Seth Hall)

1.6-dev-1044 | 2011-08-05 19:07:32 -0700

  * Fixing memory (and CPU) leak in log writer.

  * Fixing crash in memory profiling. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixing missing sync in cluster setup. (Robin Sommer)


1.6-dev-1038 | 2011-08-05 18:25:44 -0700

  * Smaller updates to script docs and their generation. (Jon Siwek)

  * When using a `print` statement to write to a file that has raw output
    enabled, NUL characters in string are no longer interpreted into "\0",
    no newline is appended afterwards, and each argument to `print` is
    written to the file without any additional separation. (Jon Siwek)

  * Test portatibility tweaks. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixing PktSrc::Statistics() which retured bogus information
    offline mode. Closes #500. (Jon Siwek)

  * --with-perftools configure option now assumes --enable-perftools.
    Closes #527. (Jon Siwek)

1.6-dev-1018 | 2011-07-31 21:30:31 -0700

  analyzers. (Robin Sommer)

- Bugfix for potential segfault in DebugLogger. (Robin Sommer)

1.6-dev.226 Thu Jul 21 15:23:39 PDT 2011

- Extensions to the @load and @unload process. (Jon Siwek)

    * Make @load statements recognize relative paths. For example a
      script can do "@load ./foo" to load a script named foo.bro that
      lives in the same directory or "@load ../bar" to load a script
      named bar.bro in the parent directory, even if those directories
      are not contained in BROPATH.

    * Reimplementation of the @prefixes statement. (Closes #486)

      Any added prefixes are now used *after* all input files have
      been parsed to look for a prefixed, flattened version of the
      input file somewhere in BROPATH and, if found, load it. For
      example, if "lcl" is in @prefixes, and site.bro is loaded, then
      a file named "lcl.site.bro" that's in BROPATH would end up being
      automatically loaded as well. Packages work similarly, e.g.
      loading "protocols/http" means a file named
      "lcl.protocols.http.bro" in BROPATH gets loaded automatically.

    * Fix @unload'd files from generating bro_script_loaded event.

    * Updates to tests.

1.6-dev.225 Wed Jul 20 17:10:41 PDT 2011

- IRC improvements (Jon Siwek). Including:

    * Shorten what's displayed in the IRC's log mime_type column for
      DCC transfers.

    * Add IRC unit tests.

    * Fix IRC analyzer supplying wrong type to irc_dcc_message event.

    * Removed irc_client and irc_server events.

    * Added is_orig arguments to all other irc events.

    * Fix analyzer not recognizing Turbo DCC extension message format.

    * Fix analyzer not generating irc_dcc_message event when irc_privmsg_message
      event doesn't have a handler registered.

- Fixing tests that need a diff canonifier. (Jon Siwek)

1.6-dev.223 Tue Jul 19 19:10:36 PDT 2011

- Adding a script to update CHANGES and VERSION. (Robin Sommer)

1.6-dev.218 Tue Jul 19 18:16:44 PDT 2011

- Comprehensive policy script overhaul/rewrite. (Seth Hall)

  Changes are too extensive to list individually.

- Removing undocumented -H command line flag. (Robin Sommer)

- Fixing many tests. (Everybody)

- Fixing 0-chunk bug in remote logging. (Robin Sommer)

- $PATH is now appropriately set by the bro-path-dev.(sh|csh) scripts.
  (Seth Hall)

- Making valgrind a bit more happy. (Robin Sommer)

- New BiF record_field_vals() that returns the fields of a record in a
  table with meta-information. (Robin Sommer)

- Adding a script in aux/devel-tools that extracts a connection from a
  trace based on uid. (Robin Sommer)

- Fixing bug causing crash when running without arguments. (Robin Sommer)

- A new event bro_script_loaded() raised for each policy script
  loaded. Also removing the -l command-line option as that can now be
  done at the script-level. (Robin Sommer)

- Fixing memory leaks. (Gilbert Clark, Seth Hall, Robin Sommer)

- Many SSL analysis improvements and fixes. (Seth Hall)

- Fixing bug with event priorities potentially being ignored for the
  handler. (Robin Sommer)

- Overhauling the internal reporting of messages to the user. The new
  Reporter class is now in charge of reporting all errors, warnings,
  informational messages, weirds, and syslogs; and it passes
  everything through the script layer. (Robin Sommer)

* Removed the alarm statement and the alarm_hook event. (Robin Sommer)

- Adding new policy file test-all.bro that loads all other policies.
  This is for testing only. (Robin Sommer)

- A new framework for doing regression testing with larger traces and
  more complex Bro configurations in testing/external. (Robin Sommer)

- Many updates to script doc generation.  (Jon Siwek)

1.6-dev.146 Sat Jun 25 18:12:27 PDT 2011

- DNS mapping are now becoming invalid when an entry's TTL expires.
  (Thomas Other)

- Reworking how Bro tracks which scripts are already loaded. Rather
  than paths, Bro now tracks inode numbers. (Jon Siwek)

- New BiF netstats() to query packet capture statistics. The netstats
  script now uses the new BiF to periocally report packets drops. The
  net_stats_update() event and the heartbeat_interval global went
  away. (Seth Hall)

- Fixing bug with logging &optional records. Closes #476. (Robin
  Sommer)

- Fixing istate.events-ssl test failing because of expired cert. (Jon
  Siwek)

- A large number of improvements and fixes for Bro's doc mode. (Jon
  Siwek)

- Significant updates for RPC and NFS analyzers (Gregor Maier)

    * Unify semantics for UDP and TCP connections.

    * RPC can now log to a log file if desired.

    * Portmapper can now log general activity to a log file and also log
      actual port mappings.

    * NFS analyzer now supports significantly more procedure calls as
      as file name tracking and file content extraction.

- NetBIOS fixes. (Jon Siwek)

- A number of unit tests are more robust and portable.  (Jon Siwek)

- A new BiF unique_id() that returns a string that's unique across Bro
  instaces with high probablity.  (Robin Sommer)

- Complete rewrite of the BinPAC SSL analyzer. (Seth Hall)

    * DER certificates are extracted as strings to be used with
      corresponding BiFs.

    * x509_verify function to verify single certs and/or full
      certificate chains.

    * Removed hand written SSL analyzer.

    * The ssl.bro script is just a place-holder for now. New version
      will come with the other new scripts.

- New syslog analyzer. (Seth Hall)

- @load now supports loading a directory. With a directory "foo"
  somewhere in BROPATH, "@load foo" now checks if there's a file
  "foo/__load__.bro". If so, it reads that file in. (Robin Sommer)

- ASCII logger now escapes non-printable characters. Closes #450.
  (Robin Sommer)

- Packaging tweaks and rewrite of 'dist' target. (Jon Siwek)

- Changes to allow DEB packaging via CPack, addresses #458. (Jon
  Siwek)

- An extension to the ICMP analyzer to handle redirects. Julien
  Sentier

- Removing old istate test-suite. (Robin Sommer)

- A hack to report missing GeoIP support only once. This closes #357,
  but #455 captures the need for a more general solution. (Robin
  Sommer)

- Bugfix: vectors in records were not initalized. Closes #421. (Robin
  Sommer)

- If IPv6 default is not compiled in, the default BPF filters now
  excludes IPv6 packets. (Robin Sommer)

- New bif bro_has_ipv6() to check whether IPv6 support is compiled in.
  (Robin Sommer)

- Updating btests and a Makefile. "make" now runs all the tests.
  (Robin Sommer)

- Moving the test-scripts from the old test-suite over to btest.
  (Robin Sommer)

- Fix for major bug in POP3 analyzer, which didn't recognize '.'
  terminators in multi-line replies if the terminator was bare (no
  newline). This caused it to ignore the rest of the session that it's
  analyzing. (Vern Paxson)

- Fix compiler warning with gcc-4.4.4 (Gregor Maier)

- Adding example documentation for a script's use of logging features.
  (Jon Siwek)

- Adding &log attribute to static attr_names array. (Jon Siwek)

- Bro can now track packet and byte counts per connection. (Gregor
  Maier)

    * If 'use_conn_size_analyzer' is true, the event engine tracks
      number of packets and raw IP bytes per connection. If
      report_conn_size_analyzer is true, these values are included as
      four new columns into conn.log

    * I changed conn.bro so that the value of
      report_conn_size_analyzer follows that of
      use_conn_size_analyzer. For the new conn.log, we probably want
      to get rid of report_conn_size_analyzer anyway.

- Fixing numerous compiler warnings and portability issues. (All)

- Switching vectors from being 1-based to 0-based. Note that this is a
  change that break backwards-compatibility. (Robin Sommer)

- Increasing serialization format version for the recent 64-bit
  changes. (Robin Sommer)

- Support for (mixed) MPLS and VLAN traffic, and a new default BPF
  filter. (Seth Hall and Robin Sommer)

    * Merging in the patch from #264, which provides support for mixed
      VLAN and MPLS traffic.

    * Changing Bro's default filter from being built dynamically to
      being a static "ip or not ip". To get the old behaviour back
      (i.e., the dynamically built filter), redef "all_packets" to
      false.

    * print-filter.bro now always prints the filter that Bro is
      actually using, even if overriden from the command line. (Robin
      Sommer)

- Changing the HTTP's analyzers internals to use 64-bit integers.
  (Gregor Maier).

- Fixing bug with deleting still unset record fields of table type.
  (Robin Sommer)

1.6-dev.99 Fri Apr 22 22:10:03 PDT 2011

- Extending the connection record with a unique identifier. (Robin
  Sommer)

    type connection: record {
        [...]
        id: string;
   };

  These identifiers very likely unique even across independent Bro
  runs.

- Delete operator for record fields. (Robin Sommer)

  "delete x$y" now resets record field "x" back to its original state
  if it is either &optional or has a &default. "delete" may not be
  used with non-optional/default fields.

- Fixing bug with nested record coercions. (Robin Sommer)

- Fixing a do_split() bug. (Seth Hall)


1.6-dev.94 Thu Apr 21 19:51:38 PDT 2011

- Fixing generation of config.h. (Jon Siwek)

- Updates and tests for NetBIOS name BiF. (Seth Hall)

- Fixing do_split bug(), and adding a test. (Seth Hall)

- When Bro is given a PRNG seed, it now uses its own internal random
  number generator that produces consistent results across sytems.
  Note that this internal generator isn't very good, so it should only
  be used for testing purpses. (Robin Sommer)

- The BTest configuration now sets the environemnt variables TZ=UTC
  and LANG=C to ensure consistent results. (Robin Sommer)

- Logging fixes. (Robin Sommer)

1.6-dev.88 Wed Apr 20 20:43:48 PDT 2011

- Implementation of Bro's new logging framework. We will document this
  separately. (Robin Sommer)

- Already defined record types can now be further extended via the
  '+=' operator. The added fields must be either &optional or have a
  &default value. (Robin Sommer)

  Example:

        type Foo: record {
            a: count;
            b: count &optional;
        };

        redef record Foo += {
            c: count &default=42;
            d: count &optional;
        };

        global f: Foo = [$a=21];

        print f;

  Output:

        [a=21, b=<uninitialized>, c=42, d=<uninitialized>]

- Enabling assignment of empty vectors ("vector()"). (Robin Sommer)

- Fixing attributes to allow &default attributes to be associated with
  records fields of type tables/sets/vector. (Robin Sommer)

- '[]' is now a valid record constructor. (Robin Sommer)

- A instance of a record type A is now coercable into one of type B if
  the fields of type A are a subset of those of type B. (Robin Sommer)

- A number of bug fixes and enhancements for record/set/table/vector
  coercion. (Robin Sommer)

- Fixing a problem with records that have optional fields when used as
  table/set indices. Addresses #367. (Robin Sommer)

- Fixing an off-by-one error in join_string_vec(). (Seth Hall)

- Updating to_count() to cope with 64bit ints. (Seth Hall)

- A new BiF count_to_v4_addr() to turn a count into an IPv4 address.
  (Seth Hall)

1.6-dev.80 Mon Apr 18 14:50:54 PDT 2011

- New framework for generating documentation from Bro scripts. (Jon
  Siwek)

  This includes:

    * Changes to Bro's scanner/parser to facilitate automatic
      generation of Bro policy script documentation in
      reStructuredText format.

    * New command line flags -Z/--doc-scripts to enable the new doc
      generation mode.

    * Changes to bifcl to pass comments starting with "##" through
      into the generated .bro script.

    * A "doc" build target for the top-level Makefile to first
      generate reStructuredText for a defined set of Bro policy
      scripts, and then run that through Sphinx to create HTML
      documentation.

1.6-dev.78 Mon Apr 18 12:52:55 PDT 2011

- Adding files to CMake build targets so they show up in generated IDE
  projects. This addresses #413. (Jon Siwek)

- Fix unnecessary config.h preprocessor (re)definitions. This
  addresses #414. (Jon Siwek)

- Updating istate tests. (Robin Sommer)

- Adding files to CMake build targets so they show up in generated IDE
  projects.

- Porting the istate tests to btest (not finished) (Robin Sommer)

1.6-dev.63 Mon Mar 21 16:31:15 PDT 2011

- Changes to the way user-modifiable config files are installed  (Jon Siwek)

    * Duplicates of the distribution's configuration files are now
      always installed with a .example suffix

    * Added --binary-package configure option to toggle configure
      logic specific to the creation of binary packages.

    * When not in binary packaging mode, `make install` never
      overwrites existing configure files in case they've been
      modified. The previous behavior (CMake's default) would only
      avoid overwriting modified files if one consistently uses the
      same build directory and doesn't reconfigure.

- Fixed an issue with Mac package's pre-install script not preserving
  ACLs. (Jon Siwek)

- Minor cleanup/refactor of the make-mac/rpm-packages scripts. (Jon

      from C++)
    * Extended const declarations in bif files.

  See http://bro.icir.org/devel/bif-doc for more information.

- Fine-tuning of the HTTP analyzer in terms of raising protocol
  violations and interrupted transfers. (Gregor Maier)


1.6-dev.21 Wed Jan 19 17:36:02 PST 2011

- Added 4 new BiFs and a new record type for testing the entropy of
  strings. (Seth Hall)

    find_entropy(data: string): entropy_test_result
        This is a one shot function that accepts a string and
        returns the result of the entropy calculations.

    entropy_test_init(index: any): bool
        This and the next two functions are for calculating entropy
        piece-wise. It only needs an index which can be any type of
        variable. It needs to be something that uniquely identifies
        the data stream that is currently having it's entropy
        calculated.

    entropy_test_add(index: any, data: string): bool
        This function is used to add data into the entropy
        calculation. It takes the index used in the function above
        and the data that you are adding and returns true if
        everything seemed to work, false otherwise.

     entropy_test_finish(index: any): entropy_test_result
        Calling this function indicates that all of the desired data
        has been inserted into the entropy_test_add function and the
        entropy should be calculated. This function *must* be called
        in order to clean up an internal state tracking variable.
        If this is never called on an index, it will result in a
        memory leak.

  The entropy_test_result values have several measures of the
  entropy, but a good one to work with is the "entropy" attribute.
  It's a double and as the value approaches 8.0 it can be considered
  more and more random.  For example, a value of 7.832 would be
  quite random but a value of 4.671 is not very random.

1.6-dev.20 Wed Jan 19 17:30:11 PST 2011

- BRO_DNS_FAKE is now listed in the --help output. (Seth Hall)


1.6-dev.18 Wed Jan 19 16:37:13 PST 2011

- Removing unnecessary expire timer from http_sessions. (Gregor
  Maier)


1.6-dev.16 Sat Jan 15 14:14:21 PST 2011

- Updates to the build system. (Jonathan Siwek)

    * ``make dist`` is now available to be used with the top-level
      Makefile for creating source packages according to #344.

    * ``make-rpm-packages`` and ``make-mac-packages`` scripts can
      now generate binary packages according to #295.

    * Additional configure options to change packaging behavior.

    * OS X builds will now prefer to link static libraries of
      optional dependencies that don't come with the vanilla
      operating system.

    * Fix for OS X 10.5 compile error dealing with the llabs()
      function from stdlib.

    * Installing as a different user than the one that
      configured/built now works (although, a harmless error message
      about not being able to write the install manifest may occur).


1.6-dev.3 Wed Dec  8 04:09:38 PST 2010

- Merge with Subversion repository as of r7137. Incorporated change:

    * Fix for packet processing resumption when a remote Bro dies
      during state synchronization (Robin Sommer).

1.6-dev.2 Wed Dec  8 03:57:03 PST 2010

- Compatibility fix for OpenSSL 1.0.0 (Christian Kreibich, Gregor
  Maier).

1.6-dev.1 Sat Nov 27 12:19:47 PST 2010

- Merge with Subversion repository as of r7098. Incorporated changes:

    * Rotation post-processors are now passed an additional argument
      indicating whether Bro is terminating (Robin Sommer).

    * Bro now consistently generates a file_opened event for all
      fopen() calls. (Robin Sommer).

    * You can now redefine the email_notice_to function (Robin
      Sommer).

1.6-dev.0 Fri Nov 26 13:48:11 PST 2010

- The Bro source code is now developed in the new git repositories.
  See the developer pages at http://www.bro-ids.org for more
  information on the new development process.

- Bro's build and installation setup has been moved from GNU
  autotools to CMake. As a result of that, layout and specifics of
  the distribution has changed significantly.

- Lots of pieces have been removed from the distribution that are
  either now unnecessary or are no longer maintained.

- As part of the cleanup, a numbef of Bro configure options and
  their corresponding functionality have been removed, including:

    * --disable-select-loop
    * --with-dag
    * --disable-nbdns
    * --enable-activemapping
    * --enable-activemapping
    * --enable-shippedpcap

- The previous configure option --enable-int64 is now enabled by default,
  and can no longer be disabled.

- ClamAV support has been removed, which has been non-functional for
  a while already.

1.5.3 Thu Mar  3 08:55:11 PST 2011

- Removing aux/broctl/policy/cluster-addrs.hot.bro from the
  distribution. The script is no longer needed and could in fact break
  an installation because it redefines an old variable that has went
  away. (Robin Sommer)

- Smarter way to increase the communication module's pipe's socket
  buffer size, resulting in a value closer to the allowed maximum.
  (Craig Leres)

- BroControl now also maintains links from the log archive to the
  current set of logs when running in standalone mode. (Robin Sommer)

- Bug fix for a file descriptor leak in the remote communication
  module. (Scott Campbell)

- Bug fix for BroControl to now activate trace-summary's sampling in
  cluster mode, but not anymore in standalone mode. (Robin Sommer)

- Broccoli updates:

    * Accept empty strings ("") as values in the configuration file.
      (Craig Leres)

    * Support for specifying a separate host key for SSL-enabled
      operation, with documentation update. (Craig Leres)

1.5.2 Wed Jan 12 17:34:55 PST 2011

- Portability fixes for --enable-int64 (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for Active Mapping support (Kevin Lo).

- Broccoli compiler warning fixes (Kevin Lo).

- Bug fixes for --enable-int64 and for avoiding bogus statistics /
  bad memory references when generating profiling information upon
  exit (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fixes for terminating connections (Tyler Schoenke and Vern Paxson).

- Removed now-quite-stale SSHv1 overflow detection, as it's more prone
  to false positives than useful detection (Vern Paxson).

- The SWIG file now explicitly lists those pieces from broccoli.h which it
  wants to wrap, rather than just including all of broccoli.h (Robin Sommer).

- http-header.bro now includes a global "include_header: set[string]" If it
  contains any strings, then only those headers will be processed.  If left
  empty, then you continue to get the current behavior of processing all
  headers. (Robin Sommer).

- Several changes to drop.bro (Robin Sommer):

	* If True, the new flag Drop::dont_drop_locals indicates that
	  local hosts should never be dropped.  On by default.

	* If True, the new flag Drop::debugging activates extensive debugging
	  output for the catch-and-release logic.  Off by default.

	* The timeout for tracking dropping information is now 1 day
	  rather than 7 days, to better echo the one-restart-a-day semantics
	  used in the past.

	* Bug fix for hosts once dropped by later cleared; some state
	  for them persisted.

- Portability fix for Broccoli Python bindings on 64-bit platforms (Robin
  Sommer).

- The HTTP analyzer no longer attempts to track Server/User-Agent
  versions, as these are hugely voluminous (Seth Hall).

- HTTP and SMTP no longer have extra-short inactivity timeouts, as
  these were too often leading to premature expiration of a connection
  (Robin Sommer).

- Tracking of HTTP refer[r]er's by setting log_referrer. (Vern Paxson).

- The "rst" tool (aux/rst/) now takes an optional "-I <text>" argument
  that instructs it to inject <text> as payload rather than sending a RST
  packet (Vern Paxson).  <text> must be NUL-terminated, and the NUL is not
  included.

- Bug fix for crashes in the DNS analyzer when processing replies for
  which no request was seen (Robin Sommer).

- Addressed a number of lint nits (Vern Paxson).

- Rotation post-processors are now passed an additional argument
  indicating whether Bro is terminating (Robin Sommer).

- Bro now consistently generates a file_opened event for all fopen() calls.
  (Robin Sommer).

- The "cf" utility now ignores a leading "t=" prefix, for compatibility
  with Bro's "tagged" logging format (Robin Sommer).

- You can now redefine the email_notice_to function (Robin Sommer).

- Fix for packet processing resumption when a remote Bro dies during
  state synchronization (Robin Sommer).

- OpenSSL/X509 portability fix, at long last (Gregor Maier & Christian
  Kreibich).

- Fix for compatibility with newer versions of autoconf (Gregor Maier).

- A larger BroControl update (Robin Sommer, if not marked otherwise):

  o Increasing default timeouts for scan detector significantly.

  o Increasing the manager's max_remote_events_processed to
    something large, as it would slow down the process too much
    otherwise and there's no other work to be interleaved with it
    anyway.

  o Adding debug output to cluster's part of catch-and-release
    (extends the debugging already present in policy/debug.bro)

  o Fixing typo in util.py. Closes #223.

  o Added note to README pointing to HTML version.

  o Disabling print_hook for proxies' remote.log.

  o broctl's capstats now reports a total as well, and stats.log
    tracks these totals. Closes #160.

  o Avoiding spurious "waiting for lock" messages in cron mode.
    Closes #206.

  o Bug fixes for installation on NFS.

  o Bug fix for top command on FreeBSD 8.

  o crash-diag now checks whether gdb is available.

  o trace-summary reports the sample factor in use in its output,
    and now also applies it to the top-local-networks output (not
    doing the latter was a bug).

  o Removed the default twice-a-day rotation for conn.log. The
    default rotation for conn.log now is now once every 24h, just
    like for all other logs with the exception of mail.log (which is
    still rotated twice a day, and thus the alarms are still mailed
    out twice a day).

  o Fixed the problem of logs sometimes being filed into the wrong
    directory (see the (now gone) FAQ entry in the README).

  o One can now customize the archive naming scheme. See the
    corresponding FAQ entry in the README.

  o Cleaned up, and extended, collection of cluster statistics.

    ${logdir}/stats now looks like this:

      drwxr-xr-x   4 bro  wheel      59392 Apr  5 17:55 .
      drwxr-xr-x  96 bro  wheel       2560 Apr  6 12:00 ..
      -rw-r--r--   1 bro  wheel        576 Apr  6 16:40 meta.dat
      drwxr-xr-x   2 bro  wheel       2048 Apr  6 16:40 profiling
      -rw-r--r--   1 bro  wheel  771834825 Apr  6 16:40 stats.log
      drwxr-xr-x   2 bro  wheel       2048 Apr  6 16:25 www

    stats.log accumulates cluster statistics collected every time
    "cron" is called.

    - profiling/ keeps the nodes' prof.logs.

    - www/ keeps a subset of stats.log in CSV format for easy plotting.

    - meta.dat contains meta information about the current cluster
    state (in particular which nodes we have, and when the last
    stats update was done).

    Note that there is no Web setup yet to actually visualize the data in
	www/.

  o BroControl now automatically maintains links inside today's log
    archive directory pointing to the current live version of the
    corresponding log file (if Bro is running). For example:

        smtp.log.11:52:18-current -> /usr/local/cluster/spool/manager/smtp.log

  o Alarms mailed out by BroControl now (1) have the notice msg in the
    subject; and (2) come with the full mail.log entry in the body.

  o Fixing broctl's top output. (Seth Hall).

  o Fixing broctl's df output in certain situations.

  o BroControl fix for dealing with large vsize values reported by
    "top" (Craig Leres).

1.5.1 Fri Dec 18 15:17:12 PST 2009

- Due to a Python configuration problem, the original 1.5 distribution
  did not include the BroControl component, which also introduced a
  portability problem for CentOS.  These issues have now been fixed (Robin
  Sommer and Vern Paxson).


1.5 Wed Dec 16 21:28:47 PST 2009

- Bro now comes with a new framework, BroControl, for managing an
  operational Bro setup, including support for installation, configuration,
  and maintainance tasks such a log archival and mail notification.  The
  framework transparently supports both traditional standalone setups as
  well as cluster installations in which multiple Bro boxes coordinate to
  analyze a high-volume network link.

  See aux/broctl/README for more information about BroControl.

  Note, BroControl supersedes the older BroLite system, which is no longer
  supported and has been deprecated for a while now.

- Numerous adjustments to DPD = dynamic protocol detection (Robin Sommer):

    o The Analyzer::ProtocolViolation?() method can now be passed the
      offending data (which POP3, SMTP, and FTP now do).  This information
      is added to the "reason" string passed to the script level.

    o SMTP now more accurately reports violations.

    o FTP stops processing when client & server successfully negotiate
      an AUTH scheme (leading to subsequent encryption).

    o Analyzer::ProtocolViolation() is virtual, and
      TCP_ApplicationAnalyzer() overrides it to not report violations
      for any partial connections, because very likely these arise just
      due to the analyzer getting confused.

    o TCP::IsPartial() returns true if any side did not start with
      a SYN packet (used to be just be for the originator).

    o The connection_state_remove handler in conn.bro now has a higher
      &priority so that other handlers for the same event can use
      determine_service() and see any changes it performs.

    o DynDisable:max_volume specifies a volume limit (default 10K).
      Once a connection exceeds this limit, further protocol
      limitations will neither raise ProtocolViolation notices nor
      cause the analyzer to be disabled.

    o The event engine no longer raises protocol_violation events for
      TCP connections which had gaps, as these have proven too unreliable.
      (Note that, ideally, the *analyzers* should avoid reporting
      protocol_violations when they can't reliably parse a connection
      anymore after a gap; but many don't.)

- A set of new script functions provide support for incrementally computing
  MD5 checksums (Seth Hall).

	md5_hash_init(index: any): bool
		Initializes an incremental hashing instance.  "index" is
		a value of arbitrary type, used to identify this particular
		instance (you can have multiple concurrent instances by
		using different index values).  Returns T on success,
		F on failure (such as the index is already in use).

	md5_hash_update(index: any, data: string): bool
		For the given hashing instance, updates the hash
		based on the given data.  Returns T on success, F on
		failure (such as the index has not been initialized).

	md5_hash_finish(index: any): string
		Returns the MD5-printable hash for the given index
		and terminates the instance, or the string "" if the
		index was not active.

- Bro now supports a believed-to-be-robust mechanism for estimating the
  proportion of traffic that it failed to capture ("measurement drops"),
  which can arise due to overload in either Bro itself, the kernel's
  packet filter, or problems with the link tapping mechanism (Vern Paxson).
  The event engine can generate estimates for either live traffic or what
  was previously recorded in a trace file, though traces subject to some
  forms of selective omission (such as skipping over parts of a connection
  to reduce storage) can lead to erroneous values.

  The estimates are based on observing gaps in TCP data streams, and
  come in two forms: the rate at which such gaps appear, and the relative
  volume of data missing due to the gaps.  (We've found however that the
  volume-based estimator is not robust due to occasional packets with
  incorrect sequence numbers, so this estimator is off by default.)

  The easy way to get the estimates is to load capture-loss.bro.
  By default, it generates a CaptureLossSummary notice upon Bro's exit,
  which can look like:

	1130222759.344066 CaptureLossSummary estimated rate = 0.00089124 / 0.000970997 (events/bytes)

  If the estimated loss is none, however, it suppresses this notice,
  unless you redef CaptureLoss::summary_if_none to T.

  You can also get finer-grained access by defining a "gap_report"
  event handler and redef'ing gap_report_freq to a non-zero interval
  (such as "10 sec").  This event allows you to pinpoint regions in
  time that exhibit significant capture loss.  See capture-loss.bro
  for an example of a handler for this event.

  Finally, these changes include a number of fixes to Bro's
  ack_above_hole/content_gap analysis, which is now significantly
  more robust.

- GeoIP support now supports ASN lookups via the built-in
  function lookup_asn(a: addr): count (Scott Campbell and Seth Hall).

- The GeoIP built-in's lookup_location() and lookup_asn() now
  support IPv6 (Seth Hall).  Note, the current GeoIP distribution
  doesn't include any IPv6 databases, so for now these won't succeed,
  but the hooks are in place for when databases become available.

- lookup_location() now falls back back to the country database if
  the city database isn't available (Seth Hall).

- The new SuccessfulPasswordGuessing Notice is generated when a host
  has been seen attempting password guessing (currently only for FTP
  sessions) and then successfully logs in (Royal Chan).  You can control the
  threshold for such reports in terms of how many attempts the host must
  have made by redef'ing the variable password_guessing_success_threshhold,
  which defaults to 20.

- The new script http-detect-passwd.bro analyzes the Web items returned
  for fetches that appear to be accessing the passwd file (Akhil Dhar).
  It generates a PasswordFullFetch Notice if it appears that the item
  includes a full password file, and PasswordShadowFetch if it looks like
  a shadowed password file.

- The new built-in

	system_env(cmd: string, env: table[string] of string)

  works like system(), but puts the table entries into the environment
  before invoking the command (Robin Sommer).  Each <index> in the table
  creates an environment variable of the form "BRO_ARG_<index>", whose
  value is the corresponding table entry.

- The new script function

	execute_with_notice(cmd: string, notice_info)

  executes "cmd" with an environment containing the fields of the
  notice_info, i.e., the information associated with a Notice (Robin Sommer).
  Per the new system_env() function above, the environment variables appear
  as "BRO_ARG_<tag>", where <tag> is the field tag as it appears in
  notice.log when you enable use_tagging.

- The new built-in enable_raw_output(file) acts the same as
  the attribute &raw_output (Seth Hall).

- The new built-in file_opened(f: file) event is generated any time Bro
  opens a script-level file (Justin Azoff).  You can use this, for example,
  if you want to ensure that a given file has a prelude in it such as
  human-readable headers, even when the file is rotated.

- The notice_info record has a new field

	aux: table[string] of string &optional

  which you can use for information specific to a given type of notice
  (Robin Sommer).  Entries in $aux appear as "aux_<index>" tags in notice.log.

- Another new notice_info record field is the boolean do_alarm (default=T),
  which, if set to F, overides a notice action otherwise specifying to
  generate an alarm (Robin Sommer).  In other words, if do_alarm is F, no
  alarm will be generated independent of the notice action.

  This is a work-around for the fact that we can't specify more than one
  action.  In particular, we couldn't NOTICE_DROP but then *not* alarm,
  which we now can by returning NOTICE_DROP yet setting do_alarm to F.

- The notice_info record field $dropped now appears in the tagged output
  format if true (Robin Sommer).

- NOTICEs relating to scan detection now no longer include the connection
  that triggered the notice, as it really doesn't contain any useful
  information, given that the particular trigger simply depends on the
  detection algorithm and its parameters (Robin Sommer).  However, we do
  explicitly set $p (port number) in the notice, and also $n with the
  number of attempts.

- drop.bro now hardwires a Catch-and-Release redrop after seeing one
  connection from a previously-dropped-but-already-released host
  (Robin Sommer).

- drop.bro now provides some new hooks (Robin Sommer):

	event address_dropped(a: addr)
		Generated when an address has been dropped.

	event address_restored(a: addr)
		Generated when connectivity to an address has been restored,
		such as using the Catch-and-Release mechanism.

	event address_cleared(a: addr)
		Generated when an address that was dropped in the past is
		no longer being monitored looking for new connections
		(as part of the Catch-and-Release mechanism).

- The new built-in function

	hexdump(data_str: string) : string

  returns a hex dump representation of the given input data (Christian
  Kreibich).  The dump renders 16 bytes per line, with hex on the left and
  ASCII (where printable) on the right.

- Bro's notion of when a TCP connection begins now dastes to the first
  instance of an initial SYN packet seen, rather than the last (Gregor Maier).

- The Time Machine script tm-contents.bro now generates

	event contents_saved: event(c: connection, orig_file: string,
					resp_file: string)

  when the content of a connection has been completely saved to disk
  (Robin Sommer).

- The mime.bro script now exports the MIME header callback table, and also
  marks it as &redef'able so you can modify its entries (Matthias Vallentin).
  The mime_log file is also now exported.

- A new signature file, policy/sigs/http-bots.sig, contains signatures
  to detect some of the current HTTP based controlled bot families (Seth Hall).

- The signature engine's HTTP pattern matching has been fixed (Seth Hall)
  to align with the documentation at:

  http://www.bro-ids.org/wiki/index.php/Reference_Manual:_Signatures#Content_conditions

  In particular, the content condition "http" is now referred to as
  "http-request" (though "http" still works for backward compatibility),
  "http-request-header" and "http-reply-header" now provide access to
  headers seen in only one direction, and similarly for "http-request-body"
  and "http-reply-body".  (This latter is still accessible as "http-body"
  for backwards compatibility.)

- The new script variable max_remote_events_processed: count (default 10)
  sets a limit on the number of remote events processed in each round,
  before tending to other inputs (Robin Sommer).

- If you set the new script variable dump_used_event_handlers to T,
  then on startup Bro dumps out all of the event handlers that the
  loaded set of scripts can invoke (Matthias Vallenti).

- Summaries for DNS PTR scanning now use a separate Notice,
  DNS_PTR_Scan_Summary, rather than overloading DNS_PTR_Scan (Robin Sommer).

- scan.bro now provides a table skip_dest_server_ports: set[addr, port]
  which lists servers (defined as an address and a port) excluded from
  scan detection computations (Craig Leres and Jay Krous).

- When redefining values on the command line directly (using var=value),
  quotation marks are now implicit only if "var" is a variable of type
  string (Christian Kreibich).  This allows other string-like values
  (such as enum's) to be passed as well.

- scan.bro now explicitly loads conn.bro so that it can itself
  be loaded independently (Robin Sommer).

- login.bro depends on scan.bro (because of tracking authentication
  "scans"), so now it explicitly loads it (Vern Paxson).

- UDP_datagram_length_mismatch is now by default flagged just once per
  originating host rather than once per connection, as it can generate
  tons of messages (Vern Paxson).

- Removed now-long-boring flagging of access to Solaris "listen"
  service as "hot" (Vern Paxson).

- Removal of libedit, since libreadline provides similar functionality
  (Christian Kreibich).

- Added scripts missing from distribution: dce.bro, ncp.bro, and smb.bro
  (Vern Paxson).

- ssh.bro now exports ssh_ports (Seth Hall)

- A number of improvements to inter-Bro communication (Robin Sommer).

 (1) Remote communication now no longer includes location information for
 serialized objects; that removes quite a bit of redundacy from the network
 traffic.

 (2) The new option 'remote_check_sync_consistency" disables the cross-check
 on the receiving side of &synchronized state of whether the current value
 of a variable has the value expected by the sender. Transmitting the
 original values in addition to the updates generates quite a bit CPU &
 network load in some cases (in particular, a table of tables). The default
 for remote_check_sync_consistency is off, and so far that in particular
 seems to reduce the proxy's load quite a bit.

 (3) Complete overhaul of the internal caching of serialized objects.  The
 objective of the caching is avoid retransmitting already sent values over
 and over again. It turns out, however, that some objects are very stable
 and hardly change or get replaced (e.g., Bro types); while other change
 all the time and are hardly reused some time later (e.g., Vals).  Now
 we maintain *two* caches independently for these types of objects; one
 with a low turn-over one and another with a high one.  This should reduce
 CPU load on both sender and receiver sides.

 The new scheme is only used if both communicating Bros support it; with
 older Bros, as well as with Broccoli, we continue using the old scheme.

- Some reworking of remote printing (Robin Sommer), as follows.  Bro now
  uses a new interprocess message rather than print_hook events, to better
  manage buffering and associated load (these can produce failures depending
  on system configuration; see remote.log).  A number of timeouts and
  buffer sizes have been tuned.  Internally, EINTR errors are now treated
  separately from EAGAIN.  Finally, even with remote_check_sync_consistency=F,
  one type of consistency check was still being done; this is no longer
  the case.

- The DNS analyzer now generates events (dns_query_reply/dns_rejected)
  for replies with zero questions (Robin Sommer).

- Perftools support for incompatible changes in the 1.0 API (Robin Sommer).

- Rearranged (generally reducing, though not always) some state timeouts
  associated with scan detection (Robin Sommer).  In addition, when a
  scanning address crosses ignore_scanners_threshold (meaning that it will
  be ignored from now on anyway), it gets discarded from all state-tracking
  tables.  Finally, the ignore_scanners_threshold now applies all kinds
  of scans, not just address scans.

- Substantial Broccoli updates, including a new initialization requirement
  that breaks backward compatibility, support for enqueueing serialized
  event data for transmission, and OpenSSL threadsafe initialization.
  See aux/broccoli/ChangeLog for details (Christian Kreibich, Robin
  Sommer, and Matthias Vallentin).

- Broccoli hashtable optimisation. See aux/broccoli/ChangeLog for
  details (Christian Kreibich & Matthias Vallentin).

- Broccoli memory leak fixed, see aux/broccoli/ChangeLog for details
  (Christian Kreibich).

- Broccoli: updates to bropipe tool (Steve Chan and Robin Sommer).

- Bug fixes for Broccoli Python bindings (Robin Sommer and Matthias Vallentin).

- Fixed nasty bug due to module scoping that completely kept stepping-stone
  detection from working (Vern Paxson).

- A serious bug in the packet sorter has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for extra NULs getting embedded in escaped strings (Seth Hall).

- Bug fix for HTTP messages that use "Connection: close" rather than length
  headers, which yielded erroneous reassembled messages with \r\n's when
  only \n's were present (Bernhard Ager).

- Fix for reporting on ICMP flows that are expired from the flow table
  (Vern Paxson).  Previously there was a race condition if the flow
  was flushed prior to its summary timer expiring.

- The -l option (list the scripts that Bro loads) now correctly prints
  scripts loaded by the prefix mechanism, and uses indentation to indicate
  the load hierarchy (Robin Sommer).

- A bug has been fixed (really, worked around) in drop.bro that prevented
  dropped addresses from being properly restored (Robin Sommer).

- Fixes for deadlocking problems in the Broccoli protocol. See
  aux/broccoli/ChangeLog for details (Christian Kreibich & Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for DNS analyzer on 64-bit machines (Gregor Maier).

- Bug fix for asynchronous DNS lookups to prevent some successful lookups
  being reported as timed out (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for tracking line numbers associated with compound statements
  (Po-Ching Lin).

- Fix for a rare condition in which the main Bro process couldn't kill
  its child process (Robin Sommer).

- Fix for file rotation when the underlying file is deleted before the
  timer expires (Robin Sommer).

- Fix for potential crash when communication connections break down,
  and also for releasing cached objects (Robin Sommer).

- Fix for default table entries computed by function invocation to not
  cache previous results (Robin Sommer).

- Fix for Bro's internal DNS resolution (Scott Campbell and Robin Sommer).

- Portability fix for DAG packet capture (Gregor Maier).

- Portability fix for --enable-brov6 (Robin Sommer).

- Portability fixes for FreeBSD (Vern Paxson).

- A work around for new_packet() crashing on IPv6 packets (Vern Paxson).
  For now, IPv6 packets are skipped.  Also, for fragments the event handler
  is now only called for the fully reassembled packet.

- The new configuration option --disable-nbdns supports disabling non-blocking
  DNS at configure time (Sean McCreary).  Note, there are some known problems
  with it in some environments.

- A number of configuration fixes and enhancements (Christian Kreibich
  and Robin Sommer).

- Consistency nit for the configuration process (Seth Hall).

- A number of reference-counting and other memory management fixes
  (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for inter-Bro communication lockup (Seth Hall and Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for computing TCP payload length in new_packet event (Lothar Braun).

- Bug fix for sending boolean True values via Broccoli (Seth Hall).

- make distcheck fix to clean up .bif.bro files (Christian Kreibich).

- Bug fix for DPD's recognition of SSLv2 connections (Seth Hall).

- Bug fix for &default for tables indexed by subnets (Seth Hall).

- A bug has been fixed that could crash Bro when you called get_event_peer()
  after a remote connection had already disppeared (Robin Sommer).

- Introduced a work-around for crashes that occur when Bro exits
  due to handling a signal (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for checkpoint.bro - don't schedule timers for times that
  aren't actually in the future (Robin Sommer).

- Hostname formatting fix for anon.bro (Fabian Schneider).

  (reported by CS Lee).

- Removed now-outdated special-casing of Linux reporting of packet filter
  statistics (Peter Wurzinger and Robin Sommer).

- A number of memory leaks fixed (Robin Sommer).

- Addressed warnings from newer versions of g++ (Robin Sommer and Vern Paxson).

- Fixed an invocation issue in the ca-create script that prevented it from
  working with recent OpenSSL versions (Craig Leres & Christian Kreibich).

- Comment fixed in drop-adapt (Justin Azoff).

- Duplicate code removed from Val (Seth Hall).


1.4 Fri Oct 17 11:08:52 PDT 2008

- We are no longer supporting a previous Bro release as the "stable"
  version.  Rather, the model now is that the current public release will
  aim for increasing stability (occasionally updated with fixes), and those
  who wish to use a "bleeding-edge" snapshot can do so via access to the
  public SVN source code repository, as explained at

	  http://bro-ids.org/wiki/index.php/Subversion#Public_Access

  Note that all previous releases remain available from the download page;
  what is changing is that we no longer commit to support for the most
  recent of these.

- We have clarified the copyright statement that covers most of the
  code to remove the "advertising clause" that derived from older
  BSD licenses, and we have removed copyright wording from most source
  code files.  See COPYING for the current wording and a list of
  files that retain their own copyright notices.

- Bro now supports analyzing NetFlow v5 data, i.e., from Cisco routers
  (Bernhard Ager).  NetFlow can be useful for intrusion detection as it
  allows analysis of traffic from many different points in the network.
  Bro can now read NetFlow data from a UDP socket, as well as (mostly
  for debugging purposes) from a file in a specialized format.  You can
  create these files with the programs given in aux/nftools.

  Command line switches:

	  -Y|--netflow <ip>:<prt>[=<id>] | read flow from socket

	    This is the usual way of getting NetFlow data into Bro by
	    opening a UDP socket on <ip>:<prt> and reading all incoming
	    packets.  Setting the <ip> to 0.0.0.0 should work on most
	    platforms.  Optionally you may set an identifier <id> for the
	    source - useful if there are many different sources you want
	    to analyze in parallel. This might also be necessary if you
	    want to use this feature with a clustered Bro.

	    Examples:
		      bro -Y 0.0.0.0:5555 netflow
		      bro -i eth0 -Y 10.0.0.1:1234=src1 brolite netflow

	  -y|--flowfile <file>[=<ident>]

	    Used to read from a file. You can optionally include an
	    identifier for the source.

	    Examples:
		      bro -y myflowfile netflow
		      bro -y myflowfile=src1 otherflowfile=src2 netflow

  Netflow Events:

	  event netflow_v5_header(h: nf_v5_header)

	    Generated upon reading a new NetFlow PDU, as summarized in the
	    argument.  The field h_id gives the flow source identifier and
	    a serial number. You can use this field to associate subsequent
	    netflow_v5_record events with their header.

	  event netflow_v5_record (r: nf_v5_record)

	    Every record within a NFv5 PDU generates a corresponding
	    netflow_v5_record() event.  The relatively complex timestamp
	    format of NFv5 is already converted to Bro's time type, and
	    the TCP header flags are separated into bools.

  The distribution includes an example analysis script, netflow.bro.
  It simply dumps received NetFlow records.  If netflow_restitch is T
  (the default), then Bro performs flow restitching as well, and two
  script variables become relevant:

	  global netflow_finished_conn_expire = 310 sec &redef;

	    specifies how long to wait for additional flow records after
	    a RST or FIN for

	  const netflow_table_expire = 31 min;

	    Its setting only affects table declarations, and therefore
	    cannot be usefully redef'd.

  Auxiliary programs:

	    Bro uses a custom format for flow data stored in files,
	    to enable preserving timestamps of the PDU arrivals and the
	    exporter's IP address.  The tools nfcollector and ftwire2bro
	    in aux/nftools/ provide ways to manipulate the Bro NF file
	    format.  The first dumps NetFlow data from a UDP socket to
	    stdout or to a file in Bro format.  The second converts NetFlow
	    data in "wire" format to Bro format, and, while doing so,
	    fakes up the exporter's IP address and timestamp.  You can get
	    "wire" format from normal flow-tools files, e.g., by using
	    'flow-export -f 4'.  Please note that the Bro format is just
	    a hack to allow for easier debugging.  Therefore the format
	    is not in fact platform independent, and not suitable for data
	    storage.

- A new DHCP analyzer generates the following events (Po-Ching Lin):

	event dhcp_discover(c: connection, msg: dhcp_msg, req_addr: addr)
	event dhcp_offer(c: connection, msg: dhcp_msg, mask: addr,
	event dhcp_request(c: connection, msg: dhcp_msg,
	event dhcp_decline(c: connection, msg: dhcp_msg)
	event dhcp_ack(c: connection, msg: dhcp_msg, mask: addr,
	event dhcp_nak(c: connection, msg: dhcp_msg)
	event dhcp_release(c: connection, msg: dhcp_msg)
	event dhcp_inform(c: connection, msg: dhcp_msg)

  where dhcp_msg values look like:

	type dhcp_msg: record {
		op: count;	# 1 = BOOTREQUEST, 2 = BOOTREPLY
		m_type: count;	# the type of DHCP message
		xid: count;	# transaction ID of a DHCP session
		h_addr: string;	# hardware address of the client
		ciaddr: addr;	# original IP address of the client
		yiaddr: addr;	# IP address assigned to the client
	};

  See dhcp.bro for the corresponding analysis script (which could
  probably use some refinements).

  Note, this analyzer is implemented using BinPAC, so you will need
  to specify --use-binpac to activate it.

- A BitTorrent analyzer is now available (Nadi Sarrar).  See the policy
  scripts bittorrent.bro and bt-tracker.bro for the events generated for
  analyzing transfers and tracker dialogs, respectively.

- The "Bro Lite" configuration is now deprecated and will not in
  general be supported (Robin Sommer & Vern Paxson).

- "make install" now only installs a core set of files (Robin Sommer).
  Policy files are now installed in <prefix>/share/bro/* (or whatever
  configure determines $datadir to be), which is now in Bro's default
  search path.  It creates a directory <prefix>/share/bro/site for local
  policy files, and the default BROPATH is extended to include this.  The
  default path no longer includes policy/local.  You can install the
  additional files used by the (now deprecated) "Bro Lite" configuration
  using "make install-brolite".

- Substantial updates to Broccoli, including support for container
  types (tables and sets) as well as a new metadata structure for event
  callbacks, facilitating truly generic event handler implementations
  (Christian Kreibich, Seth Hall and Robin Sommer). See aux/broccoli/ChangeLog
  for details.

- Extensive changes to allow Bro to process packets captured in the
  past intermingled with those captured in real-time (Matthias Vallentin
  and Robin Sommer).  This operation reflects combining Bro with use of
  "Time Machine" functionality for packet capture.

- We have unfortunately had to disable support for configuring Bro
  to use ClamAV, since it turns out that the key interface we need
  for processing blocks of memory directly rather than whole files
  is no longer supported by the package, and in fact was buggy even
  when it was (Robin Sommer).

- The new signature option "http-body /<regexp>/" matches <regexp>
  on the body data of HTTP entities (Robin Sommer).  The matching is
  done after decompressing the body, if necessary.

- The new built-in function identify_data(data: string, return_mime: bool)
  analyzes the string "data" and returns its type according to libmagic,
  if installed (Seth Hall).  The second argument controls whether it should
  be returned as a MIME-type or just an identifying string.  For example,
  identify_data("MZpofigu", F) returns the string "MS-DOS executable", and
  print identify_data("MZpofigu", T) returns "application/x-dosexec".

- The new analysis script http-identified-files.bro identifies the
  type of items returned by Web servers using libMagic (if available)
  and generates notices for interesting types and mismatches between
  URLs and types (Seth Hall).

  You configure it using two variables.  watched_mime_types is a pattern
  (default /application\/x-dosexec/ | /application\/x-executable/ ) for
  which any MIME type matching the pattern generates a HTTP_WatchedMIMEType
  notice.

  mime_types_extensions is a table mapping strings to patterns specifying
  how URLs for the given MIME type should appear.  (Ideally, this would
  be a table mapping patterns to patterns, but Bro doesn't currently support
  that.)  It defaults to:

		["application/x-dosexec"] = /\.([eE][xX][eE]|[dD][lL][lL])/

  i.e., do Windows executables end in .exe or .dll.

  You can also redef the pattern ignored_urls to specify URLs that should
  not generate complaints.  It defaults to matching Windows Update.

- The new script http-extract-items.bro extracts the items from HTTP
  traffic into individual files (Vern Paxson).  Files are named:

	<prefix>.<n>.<orig-addr>_<orig-port>.<resp-addr>_<resp-port>.<is-orig>

  where <prefix> is a redef'able prefix (default: "http-item"), <n> is a
  number uniquely identifying the item, the next four are describe the
  connection tuple, and <is-orig> is "orig" if the item was transferred
  from the originator to the responder, "resp" otherwise.

- The workings of how Bro interfaces to external programs for dropping/
  restoring connectivity of misbehaving hosts has been significantly
  reworked (Brian Tierney and Robin Sommer).

  First, dropping decisions used to be made directly by analyzer scripts,
  such as scan.bro directly calling drop_address().  Now instead the
  scripts generate Notices and then the notice policy can have an
  action of NOTICE_DROP to codify that the response to the given Notice
  is to drop the source.  The new notice_action_filter of drop_source
  drops the source of notices, and drop_source_and_terminate both
  drops the source and terminates the corresponding connection.

  So, to drop all sources triggering a specific notice, one can now, e.g.,
  write:

	redef notice_action_filters += { [Hot::SSH_Overflow] = drop_source };

  Related to this change, notice_info has a new field $dropped, set to
  true if the Notice triggered a (successful) drop.

  Second, by redef'ing Drop::use_catch_release to T (default F) you can
  activate "catch-and-release" logic.  You use this mode when you need to
  manage a limited number of possible blocks, or to build in automatic
  "forgiveness" in situations where blocked sources might become benign
  (such as due to dynamic IP addresses).  If a source has been idle for
  Drop::drop_time, then it is unblocked.  However, if it is again seen as
  block-worthy, then it is blocked for an interval of Drop::long_drop_time.

  Third, ICMP scanning is now reported by its own notice, ICMPAddressScan,
  rather than Scan::AddressScan.

- Google's perftools have replaced mpatrol for leak-checking and
  heap-profiling (Robin Sommer).  If Bro is compiled with --enable-perftools
  and configure finds the perftools, there are two command-line options
  available:

	-m turns on leak checking of the main packet loop, with some
	   uninteresting leaks are suppressed.  Currently, with one
	   exception (the RPC analyzer; problem not yet found), it reports
	   no leaks when running the test suite.

	-M turns on heap profiling: Bro will take a snapshot of the heap
	   before starting the main packet loop and another one when
	   finished. These snapshots can then be analyzed with pprof.

  For more information about the perftools see

	http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools

- Notice tags are now generated in a pseudo-unique fashion that, with high
  probability, ensures that tags generated by separate Bro processes don't
  clash when logged to a common location, such as for a Bro cluster (Robin
  Sommer).  Tags are now string's rather than count's, and are associated
  with all notices, not just that are connection-related.  You can however
  redef the string notice_tag_prefix or the function new_notice_tag to
  further control how such tags are generated.

- Four new built-ins for type conversion (Robin Sommer):

	function double_to_interval(d: double): interval
	function addr_to_count(a: addr): count
	function port_to_count(p: port): count
	function count_to_port(c: count, t: transport_proto): port

- Many policy scripts have been modified to use modules & scoping
  (Robin Sommer and Matthias Vallentin), which may require updates to
  existing scripts/refinements.

- The new script variable dpd_conn_logs (default F), if true, changes the
  semantics of the service field in connection logs written to conn.log,
  as follows (Robin Sommer).  It becomes a comma-separated list of analyzers
  confirmed by DPD to parse the connection's payload.  If no analyzer could
  confirm its protocol, but the connection uses a well-known port, the
  service is the name of the port with "?" appended (e.g., "http?"), as
  long as the corresponding analyzer has not declined the connection.
  In addition, ftp-data sessions are labeled "ftp-data" and portmapper
  connections are labeled with the specific method-call (just as before).

  dpd_conn_logs defaults to F because the change in semantics may break
  scripts that parse conn.logs; but it will likely change to the default
  in the future. With dpd_conn_logs turned off, conn logs are generated
  as they used to be, with a few rare exceptions (with previous versions,
  the service field was sometimes determined while the connection was still
  alive; now it's always determined at the time when the conn.log entry
  is written out).

- The SSL analyzer has been rewritten using BinPAC, with a number of
  robustness improvements (Tobias Kiesling).  It currently is only used
  if you execute with --use-binpac.

- Python bindings for Broccoli are now available in
  aux/broccoli/bindings/python/ (Robin Sommer).  See README/README.html
  in that director for details.

- The new "auth" option in remote.bro indicates whether a given side is
  considered "authoritative" for shared state, in which case it sends its
  initial state to &sync'ed peers (Robin Sommer).  When two peers synchronize
  their state, one side sends its current set of state to the other as
  soon as the remote connection is established.  The one sending the state
  used to be the one who has been running longer; now it can also be
  explicitly set via the "auth" flag in the Remote::Destination.

- Two new tuning parameters for scan.bro (Robin Sommer):

  ignore_scanners_threshold (default 0):

	If a host has scanned more than this many hosts, it is completely
	excluded from further scan detection.  0 disables.

  addr_scan_trigger (default 0):

	A host is only tracked for address scanning once it has contacted
	this many different hosts.  Primarily intended for using a two-stage
	scan detection with a Bro cluster: first, each node searches locally
	for scanners by looking for hosts contacting more than
	addr_scan_trigger destinations.  Those hosts which do are then
	globally tracked throughout the cluster by &synchronizing the scan
	detector tables.

- When Bro serializes functions, it now does so by default using only
  their name, rather than their full value (Robin Sommer).  This prevents
  propagation of expiration functions associated with tables and sets.
  Note, currently there is no mechanism provided to switch from the
  default behavior, but the internal hooks are in place to do so.

- The new built-in variable trace_output_file gives the name of the -w
  output trace file (Robin Sommer).

- Bro no longer installs new file rotation timers when shutting down
  (Robin Sommer).

- The new policy scripts remote-print-id{,-reply}.bro support convenient
  access to printing the identifiers of a remote Bro (Robin Sommer).
  You use the script remote-print-id.bro to request and receive the
  printing; the remote Bro must have loaded remote-print-id-reply.bro
  in order to process the request.

  Example use:

	  bro -e 'redef PrintID::dst="<dst>" PrintID::id="<name-of-id>"'
			<other scripts> remote-print-id

- scan.bro has been heavily modified to better support distributed scan
  analysis (Matthias Vallentin and Robin Sommer).

- The check for unused event handlers is now turned off by default
  (Robin Sommer).  To enable, use "redef check_for_unused_event_handlers = T".

- The new script drop.bro has been split off from scan.bro to isolate
  the logic concerning dropping addresses to block scans (Robin Sommer).

- The new -l flag lists each script as it is loaded (Robin Sommer).

- Textual descriptions of identifiers now include their attributes
  (Robin Sommer).

- The new predefined function prefixed_id() returns a session identifier with
  its peer-ID prepended if it's associated with a remote Bro (Robin Sommer).
  This is now used when generating writing log files.

- remote.bro now assigns a priority of -10 to its bro_init() event handler
  to allow others a chance to modify destinations (Robin Sommer).

- A large number of BinPAC updates (Ruoming Pang and Robin Sommer).

- The new built-in type_name(v): string returns the name of the type
  of the value v (Vern Paxson).  For example, "typename(5.2)" returns
  "double".  This function is mainly for internal debugging (i.e.,
  finding mismatches between values generated by the event engine
  versus how their type is expected by the script layer).

- The new built-in str_shell_escape() does some basic escaping on strings
  that will be passed to system() (Christian Kreibich).  Note, this function
  isn't ready (robust enough) for routine use, however.

- The new built-in disable_print_hook(file) acts the same as
  the attribute &disable_print_hook (Robin Sommer).

- The new script terminate-connection.bro factors out the terminate_connection()
  functionality that used to be in conn.bro (Robin Sommer).

- The new attribute &group=<tag> can be associated with event handlers
  to group them together into a set that can be manipulated as a whole
  (Robin Sommer).  <tag> is a string reflecting the name given to the group.

  The built-in enable_event_group(group: string) turns on all the analyzers
  in a given group, and disable_event_group(group: string) deactivates them.

- The new attribute &raw_output applies to variables of type file, disabling
  escaping of non-printable characters (Seth Hall).

- You can now iterate over the characters in a string value using
  a "for" loop, e.g., "for ( c in str ) ..." (Robin Sommer).

- The new built-in

      function cat_sep%(sep: string, def: string, ...%): string

  works similarly to cat(), except that it (a) separates the values
  by "sep" and (b) substitutes "def" for empty strings (Seth Hall).

- The function string_escape() now takes a string of characters to escape
  rather than a single character (Robin Sommer).  Each character in the
  string is preceded by '\' in the return value (also any embedded '\'s,
  as before).

- The new built-in function global_ids() returns a table of all global
  identifiers along with associated information (Robin Sommer).  The
  return value has type table[string] of script_id, indexed by the name
  of the identifier and yielding records with the following fields:

	type script_id: record {
		type_name: string;
		exported: bool;
		constant: bool;
		enum_constant: bool;
		redefinable: bool;
		value: any &optional;
	};

- The new script function find_last(str: string, re: pattern) returns
  the last occurrence of the given pattern in the given string, or
  an empty string if no match (Robin Sommer).  Note that this function
  returns the match that starts at the largest index in the string, which
  is not necessarily the longest match.  For example, a pattern of /.*/
  will return just the final character in the string.

- The new script variable record_all_packets, if redef'd to T (default F),
  instructs Bro to record every packet it processes (Robin Sommer).
  Prior to introducing this variable, Bro applied a few heuristics to
  reduce recording volume.  Setting this variable also causes packets
  to be recorded very early in processing, which can be helpful for
  debugging crashes.

- If the new script flag ssl_log_ciphers is set to T (default), ssl.bro
  logs the ciphers seen (Robin Sommer).

- Much more expanded Time Machine support, now located in
  policy/time-machine/ (Robin Sommer),

- The new command line option --status-file <file> (alias -U) specifies
  the name of a file into which Bro will write an indicator of its current
  processing status (Robin Sommer).  Possible values include "INITIALIZING",
  "RUNNING", "TERMINATING", "TERMINATED".

- The new policy script targeted-scan.bro looks for repeated access from
  the same source to the same server, to detect things like SSH
  password-guessing attacks (Jim Mellander).

- The "alternative" style for printing strings (i.e., a fmt() argument
  of "%As") now renders the raw string, other than escape-expanding
  embedded NULs (Vern Paxson).  This change may be temporary, pending
  development of more fine-grained control over string rendering.

- For now we have removed the %S functionality for fmt() (Robin Sommer).
  %S was meant to print "raw" strings, but later processing of such
  printing still introduces artifacts.

- GeoIP information now includes latitude and longitude (Seth Hall).

- ssh.bro now supports the variable skip_processing_after_handshake
  which directs the event engine to omit any further processing of an
  SSH connection after its initial handshake (Seth Hall and Robin Sommer).
  This can help with performance for large file transfers but precludes
  some kinds of analyses (e.g., tracking connection size).  This change
  also adds a scope of "SSH".

- Email notification of notices now allows for separate destinations
  depending on notice type (in particular, a regular mail destination
  versus a pager destination), and also escapes the notice to prevent
  injection attacks (Seth Hall and Robin Sommer).

- The new policy script conn-flood.bro is a simple connection-flooding
  detector, mainly meant as a demonstration (Robin Sommer).

- A large number of additions to the TLS/SSL known-ciphers suite (Seth Hall).

- Serialization now uses 64-bit IDs to cache items rather than 32-bit,
  for robustness during long-running execution (Robin Sommer).

- The new script variable tcp_max_initial_window specifies, for flows
  for which ACKs have never been seen, the maximum volume of initial
  data after which Bro will assume that it is seeing only one side
  of the connection and will not buffer data for consistency checking
  awaiting the later arrival of ACKs (Robin Sommer).  It defaults to 4 KB.
  (Note, this used to be an internal value, so the behavior is not new.)
  Set to 0 to turn off this functionality and have Bro attempt to
  track all such flows.

- The new script variable tcp_max_above_hole_without_any_acks specifies,
  for flows for which ACKs have never been seen, the maximum volume of
  data above a sequence hole that Bro will tolerate for a connection
  before giving up on tracking the flow (Robin Sommer).  It defaults to 4 KB.
  (Note, this differs from tcp_max_initial_window in that this threshold
  applies to sequence holes rather than the beginning of flows.  Like
  tcp_max_initial_window this used to be an internal value.)  Set to 0 to
  turn off this functionality.

- The new script variable tcp_excessive_data_without_further_acks specifies
  a threshold similar to tcp_max_above_hole_without_any_acks, but for
  flows for which Bro has seen ACKs (Robin Sommer).  It defaults to 10 MB.
  Set to 0 to turn off the functionality.

- Equal signs ("=") in text for notices are now escaped when using the
  tagged format to keep them unambiguous from the "=" delimiters
  (Robin Sommer).

- The final tallies for notices are now processed as NoticeTally
  NOTICE's rather than directly alarm'd (Robin Sommer).

- WeirdActivity notices now include an associated connection when appropriate
  (Robin Sommer).

- Support for large (> 2^32 bytes) pcap trace files (Po-Ching Lin).

- Scoped names ("...::...") are now allowed in signature "eval"
  constructs (Christian Kreibich).

- scan.bro is now decoupled from conn.bro, i.e., you can @load the
  latter without getting the former (Vern Paxson).  As part of this
  change, the logic to invoke TRW is now in scan.bro.

- weird.bro has been updated with a number of missing Weird's (Vern Paxson).

- If when using inter-Bro communication the child Bro process terminates,
  it now also terminates the parent process (Robin Sommer).

- BinPAC analyzers now interoperate with DPD (Robin Sommer).

- Some http.bro processing options are now exported so they can be
  accessed in other scripts (Robin Sommer).

- SMTP analysis now applies to port 587/tcp as well as 25/tcp (Robin Sommer).

- $conn is now set in ServerFound notices (Robin Sommer).

- You can now create empty sets and tables using set() and table(),
  i.e., the usual set/table constructors with no arguments (Vern Paxson).
  By themselves, these have an unspecified type - you can't use them
  directly other than to assign them.  For example,

	local bad_guys: set[addr];
	...
	bad_guys = set();	# start over assuming no bad guys

- A number of scripts have been (slightly) simplified to use the
  new empty set()/table() constructors (Vern Paxson).  Note that
  these still aren't usable for field assignments in record constructors,
  nor for attributes like &default = ...

- Removed unused syntax for declaring sets based on a list of initial
  values (Vern Paxson).

- set() and table() can now be used as arguments to function calls
  (Vern Paxson).

- The vestigial &match attribute has been removed.

- POP3 is now recognized using Dynamic Protocol Detection (Seth Hall).

- The new event expected_connection_seen(c: connection, a: AnalyzerTag)
  is generated whenever a connection is seen for which we have previously
  scheduled an analyzer via expect_connection() (Robin Sommer).

- The new built-in capture_state_updates logs all changes applied to
  &synchronized variables, in a fashion similar to the capture_events()
  built-in (Robin Sommer).  An accompanying policy script,
  capture-state-updates.bro, turns this on to the file state-updates.bst.

- If the new script variable suppress_local_output is set (default: F),
  Bro suppresses printing to local files if there's a receiver for
  print_hook events (Robin Sommer).  This option is however ignored
  for files with a &disable_print_hook attribute.

- The new notice action filter function file_if_remote specifies
  that notices from sent from remote source addresses should
  have an action NOTICE_FILE (Robin Sommer).

- The new notice action filter function file_local_bro_notices specifies
  that notices generated by the local Bro instance (as opposed to a
  remote peer) should have an action NOTICE_FILE (Robin Sommer).

- An arbitrary tag can now be past to post-processors for log rotation
  (Robin Sommer).

- Default inactivity timeouts for interactive services shortened to
  1 hour (Robin Sommer).

- The scanning variables distinct_{peers,ports,low_ports} are now
  redef'able (Robin Sommer).

- The new -S (--summary-only) option for site-report.pl directs to
  only generate connection summaries (Brian Tierney)

- More useful default config file for edit-brorule.pl (Brian Tierney).

- Bro now includes a test suite in testing/istate/ for its "independent
  state" functionality (Robin Sommer).

- Support for parallel builds via make -j (Christian Kreibich).

- Bro's default search path now includes includes policy/sigs/ and
  policy/time-machine/ (Robin Sommer).

- Bro's internal processing of interprocess communication has been
  significantly overhauled to prevent potentially fatal race conditions
  (Robin Sommer).

- Bro now checks calls to fmt() at compile-time to ensure that the
  correct number of arguments are present (Vern Paxson).  This is useful
  in addition to Bro's run-time checking for arguments matching their
  corresponding format-specifiers in the case of rarely-executed statements
  that might not generate such run-time checks in routine testing.

- The ports associated with Telnet and Rlogin are now redef'able (Robin Sommer).

- MIME processing now removes leading whitespace from MIME headers
  (Sanmeet Bhatia and Robin Sommer).

- TCP "weird" events reported by the connection compressor now match
  (other than a few rare corner-cases) those produced for normal TCP
  processing (rmkml and Robin Sommer).

- Added Scan::suppress_UDP_scan_checks to control false positives
  on scan detection in environments with P2P protocols that use UDP
  (Vern Paxson).

- The internal analyzer interface now includes an EndOfData() method that
  analyzers can use to report that all of a message has been delivered
  (Robin Sommer).

- Fix for a significant memory leak in processing UDP when using -w
  (Robin Sommer).  Note: this change turns off by default trace rewriting
  for generic UDP traffic.

- Two serious regular expression bugs fixed (Vern Paxson).  In the
  first, searching for a regular expression inside a string would
  fail if the pattern occurred only after an embedded newline.  In
  the second, insufficient buffer was allocated when compiling regular
  expressions, leading to memory corruption.

- Base64 decoding bug fixes (Christian Kreibich and Ruoming Pang).

- Automatic rotation of files is now disabled for contents files written
  by the TCP reassembler, which otherwise leads to mangled files
  (Robin Sommer).

- Bro now ships with an updated version of libpcap (0.9.8), which hopefully
  fixes problems managing trace files > 4 GB in size.

- Significant bug fixes for gzip- and deflate-encoded Web items (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for secondary-filter.bro (Vern Paxson).

- Removed a naming ambiguity regarding TCP states (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for signature scanner not matching all of its input (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for using port values in signatures (Robin Sommer).

- Minor policy script tweaks: state management for weird's, processing
  of Notice tags associated with connections, and dependencies for
  irc-bot.bro (Robin Sommer).

- aux/ portability fixes (Vern Paxson).

- Workarounds added for a BinPAC deficiency, which is that code in %cleanup
  clauses can also be executed during recovery from exceptions when parsing
  new data.  This means that any delete's or Unref()'s need to also set the
  corresponding pointer to nil (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for crashes with the non-BinPAC SSL analyzer (Robin Sommer).

- Tweak to peer-status.bro since Bro now requires events to be
  declared prior to reference in a "schedule" statement (Robin Sommer).

- The signature keyword "enable" now optionally accepts the syntax
  "foo:bar" to specify "activate analyzer bar as a child of analyzer foo"
  (Robin Sommer).  This is used for example for an XML-over-HTTP analyzer
  that's in the works.

- irc-bot-syslog.bro now uses open_log_file() for its log file (including
  the logging suffix) rather than a direct open (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for tracking Blaster across a Bro Cluster (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for the HTTP BinPAC analyzer chopping the trailing character
  off of HTTP headers when generating the http_all_headers event (Gregor Maier).

- Bug fix for HTTP chunked items for which the chunk size line was terminated
  by CRLF but the CR and LF came in separate packets (Gregor Maier).

- A bug has been fixed that would cause partial lines (for line-oriented
  protocols) to fail to be processed when a connection terminated
  (Robin Sommer).

- Bro no longer treats a signal arriving before a previous signal has
  been processed as fatal, nor does it attempt processing of a termination
  signal if seemingly there are no race conditions to worry about
  (Robin Sommer).  Both of these changes are an attempt to improve
  Bro's robustness.

- Fix for attributes such as &encrypt not working in initial declarations
  but only in later redef's (Seth Hall and Robin Sommer).

- Fixes for memory leaks in SSL processing (Seth Hall and Robin Sommer).

- Fix for POP3 analyzer to not treat lines like "<space>." as message
  terminators (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for crashes arising from nil pointers in list expressions
  (Seth Hall and Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix: a signature's "enable" would activate the corresponding analyzer
  even if no event handlers were defined for it (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fixes to prevent crashes when mixing set_contents_file() with
  subsequent explicit close(), and to ensure all data written to
  file upon connection tear-down (Gert Doering and Robin Sommer).

- Configuration support for MacPorts and Fink package management systems
  (Christian Kreibich & Vern Paxson).

- Communication-only Bro's now send out email alarms (Robin Sommer).

- Writes to a file that fail due are now run-time errors rather than
  fatal internal errors, since often these occur due to the disk
  being full (Robin Sommer).

- Byte-order bug fix for lookup_location() (Robin Sommer).

- BinPAC portability fix for 64-bit machines (Bernhard Ager and Robin Sommer).

- Portability fixes for newer versions of gcc (Jan Gerrit Goebel and
  Robin Sommer).

- Some support for porting to Solaris (Stephan Toggweiler).

- Connection compressor bug fix for source and destination having the
  same IP address, such as when monitoring loopback (Robin Sommer).

- Connection compressor bug fix for connections with multiple SYNs
  (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for using already-declared local variables for looping
  over vectors in a "for" loop (Robin Sommer & Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for not processing truncated UDP packets (Tom Kho and Robin Sommer).

- Bounds-check added to BinPAC-generated code (Tom Kho and Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for checking whether an IPv6 address is part of a subnet
  (Seth Hall).

- Bug fixes for crashes relating to asynchronous DNS lookups performed
  at start-up (Robin Sommer).  These changes also lowered the timeout
  before assuming failure from 20 seconds down to 5 seconds.

- Portability and const-ness fixes (Kevin Lo and Robin Sommer).

- Suppression of some content-gap complaints when running on traces
  that have been filtered down to only TCP control packets (Robin Sommer).

- Removed unnecessary dependency in notice-action-filters.bro
  that led to errors when loading icmp.bro by itself (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for potential infinite loop in client communiation (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix in reference counting that could eventually lead to roll-over
  (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix in communication initialization (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for error recovery when encountering an unknown link layer
  (Bernhard Ager).

- Bug fix for reversing client & server in a connection (Po-Ching Lin).

1.3 Mon Jul 16 22:11:00 PDT 2007

- The Bro manual has been wikified at:

	http://www.bro-ids.org/wiki/index.php/User_Manual

  and this is the format in which it will evolve in the future
  (Christian Kreibich).

- Much more extensive support for SMB, NetBIOS and NCP (Chris Grier).

- The new attribute &priority=n defines the order of execution for handlers
  of the same event (Robin Sommer).  Handlers with higher priority are
  executed first.  n is an integer expression that must evaluate to a
  constant when the script is loaded.

  Example:
          > cat foo.bro
          event bro_init() &priority = -5 { print -5; }
          event bro_init() &priority =  5 { print 5; }
          event bro_init()                { print 0; }	# default priority=0
          > ./bro foo.bro
          5
          0
          -5

  The connection_state_remove() handler in conn.bro now has priority
  -10 and therefore executes after all other handlers for this event.
  This fixes a long-standing problem of sometimes $addl fields not showing
  up in connection summaries.

- The new expressions record(...), table(...), set(...) and vector(...)
  are constructors for the corresponding aggregate types (Vern Paxson).
  For example,

	record($foo = "hi", $bar = -6)

  is the same as the existing constructor

	[$foo = "hi", $bar = -6]

  For tables, sets, and vectors, the "..." values within the ()'s have
  the same syntax as those that you can list in variable initializations.
  For example,

	table([1, T] = "black", [4, F] = "red")

  returns a table of type "table[count, bool] of string".

	set(4, 3, -1)

  is a value of type "set[int]".

- You can associate attributes with table() and set() constructors
  (Robin Sommer).  For example:

         local s = set(1.2.3.4) &read_expire = 5 secs;

  associates a 5-second read expiration with the set assigned to s.

- Bro now explicitly supports port numbers reflecting a transport protocol
  type of "unknown" (Christian Kreibich).  Currently, this means "not TCP,
  UDP or ICMP".  The numerical value of such a port is the IP protocol,
  so ranges from 0..255.  For example:

    global p: port = 0/unknown;

    print fmt("%s", p);
    print fmt("p is TCP? %s", get_port_transport_proto(p) == tcp);
    print fmt("p is unknown? %s",
		get_port_transport_proto(p) == unknown_transport);

  yields

    0/unknown
    p is TCP? F
    p is unknown? T

  In comparisons of different protocol types, the following holds:
  unknown < TCP < UDP < ICMP.

- If your system supports "GeoIP" (see http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
  for a corresponding city database), then the new script function

	  lookup_location(a: addr): geo_location

  returns a record of geographic information associated with an address
  (Seth Hall).  The geo_location record has $country_code, $region and
  $city fields.  If no information is available, each of these will be
  set to empty strings.

  If Bro hasn't been configured with GeoIP support, or if the address is
  IPv6 that cannot be directly converted to IPv4, then Bro produces a
  run-time error and likewise returns empty strings.

- Signature-matching on HTTP components now processes the URI with
  escape sequences expanded (Robin Sommer).  Ideally, there would be
  two signature keywords, one for decoded URIs (corresponding to this
  case) and one that allows matching against the URI as originally
  transmitted.

- The connection compressor is no longer considered experimental, and
  is used by default (Robin Sommer).

- The new function lookup_hostname(host: string): addr_set asychronously
  looks up the IPv4 address(es) of the given host via DNS (Robin Sommer).
  Like lookup_addr(), this function can only be used within a "when"
  statement.

- The new built-in

	raw_bytes_to_v4_addr(s: string): addr

  takes a string that points to at least 4 bytes, and returns an address
  corresponding to interpreting these as being an IPv4 address in network
  order (Vern Paxson; suggested by Mike Dopheide).

- Trace-rewriting support for DNS, SMB (Chris Grier).

- The new script function find_all(str: string, re: pattern): string_set
  returns a string_set giving all occurrences of the pattern "re" in
  the string "str" (Robin Sommer).  (Note that string_set's are unordered.)

- The new policy script save-peer-status.bro generates a log
  to peer_status.$BRO_LOG_SUFFIX of updates received from
  communication peers (Robin Sommer).

- The policy script print-filter.bro now includes two (scoped) variables,
  terminate_bro and to_file, which control whether to exit after printing
  the filter (default T) and whether to write to the log file
  pcap_filter.$BRO_LOG_SUFFIX or (default) to stdout (Robin Sommer).

- The new script variable check_for_unused_event_handlers controls whether
  Bro checks for unused event handlers (Robin Sommer).  It defaults to T,
  which was the past behavior (always report).

- Bro now terminates if the only pending activity is future timers
  (Robin Sommer).  It used to wait for those timers to expire, but this
  can cause fundamental problems if the timers are associated with table
  management (since these might never completely drain).

- Tables and sets inside of records are now initialized to empty
  values rather than uninitialized (Vern Paxson).

- A new variable allow_services_from (in hot.bro) complements the
  existing allow_service_to variable (Brian Tierney).  It specifies
  that access to the given service from the given originator is
  allowed.

- global_sizes() no longer reports internal variables (Robin Sommer).

- The IRC analyzer is now activated if any of the (many) IRC event
  handlers are defined (Robin Sommer).

- The default value for tcp_close_delay is now 5 sec rather than 0 sec
  (Robin Sommer).  This prevents some spurious connection events.

- Improved logic for dealing with "reversed" connections such
  as backscatter (Vern Paxson).

- You can now left-justify fields when using fmt() with "%-" like
  in sprintf (Christian Kreibich).

- Updates to DNS query types (Larry Leviton).

- Added mechanism to http-header.bro to skip printing some HTTP headers
  (Larry Leviton).

- The IrcHotWord notice now sets the associated connection (Robin Sommer).

- If a notice has a tag, it's no longer overridden (Robin Sommer).

- ServerFound notices now set the port field (Robin Sommer).

- The built-in lookup_ID() now returns the string "<unknown id>" if the
  ID does not exist, rather than a run-time error (Robin Sommer).

- The new tuning option ProtocolDetector::suppress_servers specifies a
  set of analyzers for which Bro generates ServerFound notices, but not
  ProtocolFound (Robin Sommer).  This both reduces log file size and
  conserves memory.

- A new notice_action_filter, tally_notice_type_and_ignore, works the same
  as tally_notice_type but returns IGNORE (Robin Sommer)

- Setting summary_interval == 0 disables the creation of irc-bots.summary.log
  (Robin Sommer).

- If you @load foo and a directory "foo" is in your path, Bro no longer
  tries to load it (Robin Sommer).

- A number of BinPAC fixes and enhancements (Ruoming Pang, Chris Grier
  and Vern Paxson).

- BinPAC now resides in aux/binpac rather than src/binpac (Ruoming Pang
  and Christian Kreibich).  This reflects a decoupling of it from Bro so
  that it can be used to generate protocol analyzers for other projects too.

- Removed example Inktomi entries from skip_scan_sources initialization,
  since they no longer exist (Vern Paxson).

- The variable make notice_once_per_orig_tally_interval is now
  redef'able (Brian Tierney).

- SIGPROF to the communication child process now logs resource stats to
  remote.log (Matthias Vallentin).

- The new built-in getpid(): count returns Bro's process ID (Robin Sommer).

- Patterns for detecting IRC-based bots updated (Robin Sommer).

- irc-bot-syslog now logs just bots, not all IRC client/servers (Robin Sommer).

- The new variable suppress_notice_actions in notice.bro suppresses
  notice_actions events for selected notice types (Robin Sommer).

- Files opened during operation now rotate just like those opened at
  startup (Robin Sommer).

- ResourceStats now also logs elapsed time and the reported number of
  packets-on-the-link (Mark Dedlow).

- Printing a "file" value now produces its name (Robin Sommer).

- Removed deliberate truncation of payload in port 80 FIN packets
  (Vern Paxson).

- remote.log now includes received peer_descriptions (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for updating timestamps (Christian Kreibich).

- Bug fix for skipping ADU processing in adu.bro (Christian Kreibich
  and Zhichun Li).

- Fix for ICMPs that carry ICMP headers (or non-TCP/UDP/ICMP headers)
  within them (Vern Paxson).

  (Vern Paxson).

1.2 Tue Oct 17 12:09:49 PDT 2006

- Bro now supports DPD, dynamic protocol detection (Robin Sommer, Holger
  Dreger, and Michael Mai).  With DPD, Bro can analyze protocols regardless
  of what port numbers they use: it infers the protocol based on which
  application analyzers can parse it without error.  Adding this functionality
  involved extensive changes to Bro's internals, but also now enables
  multiple Bro analyzers to work on the same connection, either concurrently
  or one nested inside the other (we have not taken much advantage of this
  latter capability yet, but see the FTP events discussed below).

  There are a number of new policy scripts, events, and variables associated
  with DPD processing, as follows.

  Scripts:

	You activate DPD by @load'ing dpd.bro.  It in turn instructs Bro
	to load the signature file policy/sigs/dpd.sig.  Note that Bro
	uses signatures to expedite deciding which analyzers to try on
	a given connection; it does *not* simply use the signatures to
	make the determination of which protocol is in use, as this is
	insufficiently robust.  (At this point, Bro provides signatures
	for FTP, IRC, HTTP, SMTP, and SSH.  In the future we plan to add
	other protocols.)

	Along with dpd.bro, you need to @load detect-protocols.bro or
	detect-protocols-http.bro. The former enables general detection
	of application-layer protocols, while the latter does further
	inspection of HTTP sessions to characterize applications running
	on top of HTTP such as Gnutella or SOAP.   (Loading dpd.bro
	is separate from loading one of these scripts because in principle
	Bro could use a different means than signatures to activate
	the analyzers, although currently it does not.)

	If you @load dyn-disable.bro, then once an analyzer determines
	that it does not match a given connection, it is deactivated
	(and a Notice is generated).  Otherwise, it still proceeds to try
	its best to analyze the connection (to possibly be more robust
	against evasion).

	The scripts dce.bro and smb.bro enable DPD for the Windows DCE and
	SMB protocols, respectively.  (Note that analysis of these protocols
	is undergoing a major expansion, not yet complete.)

  Events:

	event protocol_confirmation(c: connection, atype: count, aid: count)
		Generated when the given connection has been confirmed as
		conforming with the application type (protocol) specified
		by atype. aid is a globally unique analyzer ID that identifies
		a particular analyzer instance.

		The values for atype are symbolic names associated with
		each of Bro's analyzers, such as ANALYZER_IRC.  See the
		initialization at the beginning of Analyzer.cc for the
		full set of names.

		The function analyzer_name(atype: count): string translates
		these symbolic names into text.  For example,

			analyzer_name(ANALYZER_IRC)

		yields "IRC".

	event protocol_violation(c: connection, atype: count, aid: count,
				reason: string)
		Generated when the given connection has been found to
		violate the protocol of the given application type, with
		"reason" giving details.

  Variables:

	dpd_buffer_size: count (default 1024)
		Specifies how much pending data Bro keeps for connections
		that have not been classified yet.  Once this fills, the
		data is deleted, though classification can still continue
		(see below).

	dpd_match_only_beginning: bool (default T)
		If set, specifies that Bro should stop signature matching
		if it has processed dpd_buffer_size bytes.

	dpd_ignore_ports: bool (default F)
		If set, then Bro does not take into consideration the port
		numbers associated with connections when attempting to
		classify them (which can otherwise help the process in
		some cases).

	dpd_reassemble_first_packets: bool (default T)
		If set, then Bro does TCP stream reassembly before applying
		signature-matching to detect protocols.

	likely_server_ports: set[port]
		Specifies a list of ports that Bro will consider as likely
		used by servers.  For example, if Bro sees a connection
		that has already been established (so it does not know
		which side sent the initial SYN), and one side uses a port
		in this set, then it will assume that that side is the
		server (connection responder).  The set is empty unless
		you populate it or @load server-ports.bro, which specifies
		a large number of values.

	dpd_config: table[AnalyzerTag] of dpd_protocol_config
		Specifies the DPD configuration associated with each tag.
		The type dpd_protocol_config is simply:

			type dpd_protocol_config: record {
				 ports: set[port] &optional;
			};

		i.e., an optional $ports field specifying a set of ports
		associatd with the tag.  For example, ftp.bro now includes
		the equivalent of:

			redef dpd_config += {
				[ANALYZER_FTP] = [$ports = 21/tcp]
			};

  Functions:

	The function

		expect_connection(orig: addr, resp: addr, resp_p: port,
					analyzer: count, tout: interval)

	is called to alert Bro that a new connection is expected, initiated
	by orig to a server running on resp's port resp_p (note: orig's port
	is not specified) which will correspond to the specified analyzer
	(e.g., "FILE", which is used to analyze files transferred by FTP -
	see next item).  "tout" is a timeout to associate with the waiting.

	The function

		function disable_analyzer(cid: conn_id, aid: count)

	instructs Bro to disable the analyzer that generated the current
	event, assuming the analyzer is associated with the given connection
	ID.  This is used by the dyn-disable.bro script discussed above.

- A much more complete BinPAC compiler, along with new HTTP, DNS, and
  RPC/Portmap analyzers in binpac (Ruoming Pang). The flag "--use-binpac"
  activates the BinPAC-based analyzers (currently for HTTP and DNS).
  See www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpang/binpac-paper.pdf for a description of
  BinPAC, and let Ruoming know if you are interested in using BinPAC to build
  new analyzers.

- A new type of analyzer, FILE, analyzes the contents of a connection as
  though it were a data file (Robin Sommer).  Currently, it can generate
  two events:

	event file_transferred(c: connection, prefix: string, descr: string,
				mime_type: string)
		Indicates that the connection transferred a file. "prefix"
		is the beginning of the file's data; "descr" and "mime_type"
		are indicators of the file's type, as reported by the
		"libmagic" library.

		descr/mime_type are only set if Bro is configured on a
		system that includes the "libmagic" library.

	event file_virus(c: connection, virname: string)
		Indicates the connection transferred an executable
		corresponding to a known virus of the given name.

		This functionality is only available if Bro is configured
		on a system that includes the "libclamav" library.

  Note, this analyzer is enabled via a call to expect_connection by
  the FTP analyzer.

- New events relating to IRC analysis (Robin Sommer):

	event irc_client(c: connection, prefix: string, data: string)
		Generated upon seing a client message sent over the given
		IRC connection.  "prefix" is the command's prefix as defined
		by the IRC protocol.  It is used by servers to indicate the
		true origin of the message; it may be empty.  "data" contains
		the message.

	event irc_server(c: connection, prefix: string, data: string)
		Same for server messages.

	event irc_user_message(c: connection, user: string, host: string,
				server: string, real_name: string)
		Generated upon seeing an IRC "USER" command.

	event irc_password_message(c: connection, password: string)
		Generated upon seeing an IRC "PASS" command.

	event irc_channel_topic(c: connection, channel: string, topic: string)
		Generated upon seeing an IRC server reply that includes
		the channel topic.

	event irc_global_users(c: connection, prefix: string, msg: string)
		Generated upon seeing an IRC server reply that includes
		a count of the number of IRC users.

- The new experimental script irc-bot.bro tracks IRC-based bots (Robin Sommer).
  The accompanying script irc-bot-syslog.bro syslog's the state of the
  bot analysis every IrcBot::summary_interval seconds (default 1 minute).

- The new script proxy.bro looks for open Web proxies by matching incoming
  requests to a server with outgoing requests it makes (Robin Sommer).  It
  generates HTTPProxyFound Notices when it finds one.

- Changes to notices.bro (Robin Sommer):

	- notice_policy_item's now have a default $result of
	  NOTICE_FILE and a default $priority of 1.

	- The new notice_action_filter, notice_alarm_per_orig, alarms
	  on the first NoticeType from a specific source.  Subsequent
	  instances are tallied.

	- notice_action_filters now reside in the new script
	  notice-action-filter.bro (automatically loaded by notice.bro).

	- The notice actions NOTICE_ALARM_PER_CONN, NOTICE_ALARM_PER_ORIG,
	  and NOTICE_ALARM_ONCE have been removed, as they were never
	  actually implemented.

	- If the notice_policy returns IGNORE or FILE, the action_filters
	  filters are no longer consulted.

- A new attribute for tables and sets, &mergeable, changes the semantics
  of assignments, as follows (Robin Sommer).  Given two &mergeable tables/sets
  A and B, an assignment "A = B" becomes actually a join "A = A \cup B"
  (i.e., union).  The envisoned use is to help avoid race conditions
  when doing remote state synchronization.

- The semantics of &synchronized expire_funcs has changed (Robin Sommer).
  Now, when a table entry is expired and the operation is propagated to a
  a peer, the peer will call its expire_function.

- TRW analysis now skips UDP traffic because it currently treats
  all UDP connections as failures (Robin Sommer).

- trw.bro has been split into trw-impl.bro (the algorithm) and
  trw.bro (which simply activates the analysis), to facilitate writing
  scripts that have hooks into TRW analysis but don't presume it's
  active (Robin Sommer).

- The option report_remote_notices in remote.bro has been replaced
  by a new script you include, remote-report-notices.bro (Robin Sommer).

- The new function connect_peer() explicitly connects to a remote host
  (Robin Sommer).

- The new script remote-send-id.bro sends the current value of an ID
  to a remote Bro and then terminates processing (Robin Sommer).  It's
  intended for use from the command-line, as in

	bro -e "redef dst="<dst>" id="<name-of-id>" <scripts> remote-send-id

  The other scripts must set up the connection. <dst> is an index into
  Remote::destinations corresponding to the destination.

- New built-ins {suspend,resume}_state_updates() can be called to
  temporarily avoid propagating updates to &sync'ed values (Robin Sommer).
  This can avoid duplicated activity.

- The new function terminate_communication() instructs Bro to end its
  communication with remote peers (Robin Sommer).

- The new event remote_state_access_performed is raised when remote state
  access has been performed (Robin Sommer).  This is primarily for debugging.

- The log() built-in has been renamed to ln() to avoid conflict (Vern Paxson).

- bifcl now generates event generation wrapper functions from event.bif
  (Ruoming Pang).  For example, to generate event http_reply, currently
  one writes:

		val_list* vl = new val_list;
		vl->append(BuildConnVal());
		vl->append(new StringVal(fmt("%.1f", reply_version)));
		vl->append(new Val(reply_code, TYPE_COUNT));
		if ( reply_reason_phrase )
			vl->append(reply_reason_phrase);
		else
			vl->append(new StringVal("<empty>"));
		ConnectionEvent(http_reply, vl);

  In the future, one will be able to just call bro_event_http_reply(), and
  the code generated by bifcl looks like:

	void bro_event_http_reply(Connection* c, StringVal* version,
					bro_uint_t code, StringVal* reason)
		{
		val_list* vl = new val_list;

		vl->append(c->BuildConnVal());
		vl->append(version);
		vl->append(new Val(code, TYPE_COUNT));
		vl->append(reason);

		mgr.QueueEvent(http_reply, vl, SOURCE_LOCAL, c);
		}

  Accompanying this change is a semantic shift to types "string" and "port"
  in .bif files.  They used to be translated to C++ types BroString* and
  uint32, respectively.  Now they are translated to StringVal* and PortVal*.
  The functions in bro.bif are changed accordingly, and please be aware
  of this change when you write built-in functions in future.

  Also for this change, the parameter 'new' for rsh_request has been renamed
  'new_session', as 'new' is a reserved word for C++.

- Some ICMP "connections" now have services identified ("icmp-echo",
  "icmp-unreach") rather than just listing the service as "other"
  (Ruoming Pang).

- The new option remote_trace_sync_interval specifies an interval after
  which each Bro will stop processing its trace and wait for all others
  to signal that they have reached the same time (Robin Sommer).  The
  intent is support for operating Bro in a distributed cluster fashion
  (and in particular for debugging such clusters when running off-line
  on traces).

  This option only works in pseudo-realtime mode, and requires the new
  global remote_trace_sync_peers to give the total number of remote peers
  (not including self).  Signaling is done via a new communication message
  type.

- Extensions for DNS transformation/anonymization, including introduction
  of trace transformation for protocols other than TCP (Jason Lee).
  Not yet fully developed/debugged.

- Extensions for HTTP transformation/anonymization (Martin Casado).
  Not yet fully developed/debugged.

- The $conn field is now included in HTTPProxyFound notices (Robin Sommer).

- Changed service inference algorithm to favor lower-numbered
  likely-servers over higher-numbered ones (Vern Paxson).

- In pseudo-realtime mode, Bro now uses real-time for deciding which
  peer should send state (Robin Sommer).

- Time synchronization for Bro's running on traces in pseudo-realtime mode
  added (Robin Sommer).

- Avoidance of false content gaps improved when sorting packets with
  out-of-order timestamps (Ruoming Pang).

- Packets from the packet sorter are now more robustly drained upon
  termination of input (Ruoming Pang).

- Documentation for deep-copy updated (Christian Kreibich).

- Nasty fragment reassembly bug fixed (Vern Paxson).

- Serious bugs in EDNS0 processing fixed (Vern Paxson).

- Fixed significant misfeature of interconn.bro that stopped all processing
  of a connection once it makes a detection (Vern Paxson).

- Fixes for &read_expire operation across synchronizes tables (Robin Sommer).

- Fixes for multiple peers exchanging initial &sync state simultaneously
  (Robin Sommer).

- Improvements to graceful termination of Bro when communicating with
  remote peers (Robin Sommer).

- Fix for ICMP analyzer not always generating icmp_sent events
  (Robin Sommer).  This appears to still need some work, as now
  it generates redundant events.

- Fix for initial exchange of &sync state which could lead to
  referencing unknown IDs (Robin Sommer).

- Fix to scan detection for differing semantics of connection compressor
  vs. non-compressor (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for distinguishing regular expression matches of length 0 from
  those of length 1 (Ruoming Pang).

- Fix for SSH version parsing in the presence of content gaps (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for IRC that could lead to crashes (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix to refrain from adding new timers when a connection has
  already been removed from the connection table (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for packet_contents not including the transport-layer header
  (Robin Sommer).

- Some memory leaks fixed (Robin Sommer).

- A bunch of portability and distribution problems fixed (Christian
  Kreibich, Robin Sommer, Vern Paxson).


1.1 Mon May 15 10:50:33 PDT 2006

- Bro now supports a "when" statement for taking action upon something
  becoming true asynchronously (Robin Sommer).  This provides a powerful
  new mechanism with numerous applications.

  Syntax:

	when '(' <expr> ')' <stmt> [timeout <interval> '{ <stmts> '}']

  where the first <stmt> can be a single statement or a block enclosed
  in {}'s, but the set associated with "timeout" must be enclosed in
  {}'s (to reduce ambiguities in Bro's grammar).

  Bro executes the first statement when <expr> becomes true. If you give
  a timeout and the condition has not been satisfied before it expires, Bro
  executes the second statement instead.

  A simple example:

	global t: table[addr] of count;
	event connection_established(c: connection)
	    {
	    local orig = c$id$orig_h;
	    if ( orig !in t )
		{
		t[orig] = 1;

		when ( t[orig] == 5 )
		    print fmt("%s has established 5 connections", orig);
		timeout 1 hr
		    {
		    print fmt("%s has NOT established 5 connections", orig);
		    delete t[orig];
		    }
		}
	    else
		++t[orig];
	    }

  Notes:
	- The condition may be evaluated more than once, and at arbitrary
	  times.

	- When the when-body is executed, the condition is guaranteed to be
	  still satisfied.

	- Expression reevaluation is primarily triggered by modifications
	  to globals.  However, reevaluations do not take place immediately
	  but potentially at a later point.  This means that if we change a
	  global to a value which would execute the trigger but then change
	  it back, the change may go unnoticed.

	- Inside the condition you may introduce new locals.  For example,

	    when ( (local x = foo()) && x == 42 ) ...

	  Such an assignment always yields true as its expression value
	  (but the assignment might be delayed, for example if foo() is
	  a delayed function call - see below).

  Delaying function calls
  =======================

  Functions called inside the condition of a when-clause may delay their
  results until they're ready. This works for both script-level and built-in
  functions.

  For script-level functions, there is a new construct, "return <when-stmt>",
  to delay a function's result. When used, the function returns at the
  time the when-stmt's condition becomes true, and it yields the value
  that the when-stmt's body then returns. Toy example:

      global X: table[string] of count;

      function a() : count
	    {
	    # This delays until condition becomes true.
	    return when ( "a" in X )
		  {
		  return X["a"];
		  }
	    timeout 5 min
		  {
		  return 0;
		  }
	    }

      event bro_init()
	    {
	    # Installs a trigger which fires if a() returns 42.
	    when ( a() == 42 ) { print "Yippie!"; }

	    X["a"] = 42;
	    }

  There's also a new built-in function which can delay

	lookup_addr(host: addr)

  performs asynchronous DNS address->hostname lookups. Example:

	    local h; addr;
	    [...]
	    when (local name = lookup_addr(h)) { print h, name; }

  See the function gen_hot_notice_with_hostnames() in conn.bro for
  a more worked-out example of using the "when" clause to translate the
  local address in SensitiveConnection notices to a hostname (contributed
  by Brian Tierney).  This functionality is activated by redef'ing
  xlate_hot_local_addr to T.

  Here is the full evaluation model of a when's condition:

       - The condition may be evaluated more than once, at arbitrary times.

       - It is always fully evaluated, no matter whether some former
	 evaluation has been suspended by a delaying function call.

       - All function calls which do not delay are always *fully* executed
	 each time the condition is evaluated.

       - Function calls which delay are only executed *once*; their result is
	 cached and re-used in the case the condition is evaluated again.

       - The condition is guaranteed to be true when the body is executed
	 (potentially using cached function results)

- By default Bro now uses a configuration similar to what used to be
  activated using reduce-memory.bro, along with some additional state
  timeouts that are new (Robin Sommer and Vern Paxson).  This allows for
  better state management out-of-the-box, at the cost of some precision
  of analysis and resilience to evasion.  In particular, the intent is to
  move towards being able to run Bro continuously without inexorably growing
  the amount of memory used until exhaustion.

  You can access a configuration similar to the previous default state
  management settings by loading heavy-analysis.bro.  It turns on a
  load-prefix of "heavy", so when you load XXX.bro, a file heavy.XXX.bro
  will also be automatically loaded if present.  Note that, as was the
  case for reduce-memory, you need to load heavy-analysis prior to other
  files for it to have effect.

- The new module clear-passwords.bro monitors login/FTP/IRC/POP traffic
  for cleartext passwords (Jason Lee).

- The new script service-probe.bro looks for remote hosts that repeatedly
  connect to the same service on local hosts (for a configurable set of
  services and connection sizes) in order to detect brute-forcing attacks
  such as password-guessing (Jim Mellander).

- A new ARP analyzer generates three events:

	event arp_request(mac_src: string, mac_dst: string,
			SPA: addr, SHA: string, TPA: addr, THA: string);

	event arp_reply(mac_src: string, mac_dst: string,
			SPA: addr, SHA: string, TPA: addr, THA: string);

	event bad_arp(SPA: addr, SHA: string, TPA: addr, THA: string,
			explanation: string);

  with a corresponding policy script arp.bro (Chema Gonzalez and Vern Paxson).
  It writes logs to arp.$BRO_LOG_SUFFIX.  It has not been tested much yet.

- Bro Lite changes (Jason Lee):
	- default user for is now user 'bro'
	- now uses the correct sysctl on FreeBSD 6
	- now uses the correct Perl path if site-report.pl not installed
	  into '/usr/local/bro'
	- no longer prompts to encrypt email unless you pick to email reports

- The default Bro Lite install now only checkpoints Bro once a week
  (Brian Tierney).

- Implicit Bro file extensions (such as .bro for policy scripts and .sig
  for signatures) are now searched for first rather than only if the
  non-extension-version of the file doesn't exist (Vern Paxson).  For
  example, running "bro -r trace mt" now first searches $BROPATH for
  "mt.bro" before searching for "mt", whereas it used to do these in
  the other order.

- There's now a simpler mechanism for redef'ing variables on the command-line
  (Christian Kreibich).  Any command line arguments of the form <var>=<val>
  are now expanded into policy code of the form "redef var=val;", where
  <val> is wrapped in quotation marks if the value appears to be a string
  and doesn't have quotation marks already.  This works with strings with
  whitespace such as foo="Hello World"; however, note that it means you
  can't use the mechanism to redef an enum value.

- The Bro distribution now includes (and builds by default) Christian
  Kreibich's Broccoli library (Bro C Client Library), which enables programs
  to communicate with running Bro's (Christian Kreibich and Jason Lee).
  Configure with --disable-broccoli to turn this off.

- Built-in functions log(x: double): double and exp(x: double): double
  which do natural logarithms and their inverses (Jaeyeon Jung).

- The new built-in function gethostname() returns the local host's name
  (Jason Lee & Robin Sommer).

- The new built-in function reading_traces() returns true if Bro
  is reading trace files (Robin Sommer).

- The new built-ins suspend_processing() and continue_processing() provide
  script-level control for instructing the event engine to stop or resume
  processing packets (Robin Sommer).  This is useful for coordinating
  simultaneous processing by multiple Bro's.

- Email notices are now by default sent via /bin/mail, with "[Bro Alarm]"
  in the subject.

- redef'ing a function now replaces the existing body rather than
  supplementing it (Robin Sommer), which was a bug.

- You can now configure Bro to process encapsulated IP packets either
  by setting, as before, a fixed encap_hdr_size (for VLANs), or setting
  parse_udp_tunnels to T (Ruoming Pang).  For the latter, you specify a
  UDP tunnel port using udp_tunnel_port (the previous variable "tunnel_port"
  has gone away); or you can leave it set to its default of 0/udp, in which
  case Bro will look for IP encapsulated in UDP packets on any port.

- Added a simple form of profiling based on sampling the work done
  per-packet (Vern Paxson).  The event engine generates a

	event load_sample(samples: load_sample_info, CPU: interval, dmem: int)

  event every load_sample_freq packets (roughly; it's randomized), where
  load_sample_freq defaults to 20.  "samples" is simply a set[string]; it
  contains the names of the functions, event handlers, and their source
  files that were accessed during the processing of the sampled packet,
  along with an estimate of the CPU cost of processing the packet and
  (currently broken) memory allocated/freed.

- Bro now includes experimental support for Endace DAG cards (Gregor Maier
  and Robin Sommer).  To activate, configure with

	--with-DAG=/path/to/dagtool/installation

  and use "dag0" as the network interface. You may need to configure the
  card with the dagtools first. In general, if dagsnap works, Bro should
  work as well.

- Log rotation has changed in a number of ways (Mark Dedlow & Robin Sommer):

	  * The new variable log_rotate_base_time: string, if defined,
	    specifies that logs should be rotated at log_rotate_base_time +
	    i * rotate_interval intervals. Format is as a string in
	    24-hour time, "%H:%M", e.g, "12:00".  This format may change
	    in the future to instead be a Bro time type.

	  * RotateLogs::date_format can be redefined to change format of
	    timestamps in rotated files.

	  * RotateLogs::build_name() can be redefined to implement an
	    arbitrary naming scheme for rotated files.

  Note, this code has not been extensively tested.

- Bro now by default builds a version of malloc bundled with its
  distribution (Vern Paxson & Brian Tierney).

- The syntax for the clone operator now looks like a function call,
  "copy(x)" (Vern Paxson).

- The new flag DNS::logging (default F), if T, disables generation of
  dns.log (which is often uninteresting and very large), though it
  still performs analysis leading to NOTICEs (Robin Sommer).

- A new global, hostile_domain_list, has been added to dns.bro which
  lists domains to be flagged if A or MX records are queried (Scott Campbell).

- Added globals dns_skip_all_{auth,addl} to skip all DNS AUTH/ADDL processing
  (Vern Paxson).  Skipping these is on (true) by default, because such
  processing is quite expensive.

- backdoor.bro now turns off by default some detectors that from experience
  have too many false positives, or (such as for HTTP) too many uninteresting
  true positives (Brian Tierney).  In addition:

	- the module now generates a BackdoorFound notice for each backdoor

	- the new variable dump_backdoor_packets (default F) if set causes
	  the packet that triggered the backdoor detection to be written to
	  backdoor-packets/<tag>:<time>

	- the new variable backdoor_ignore_host_port_pairs is a set[addr, port]
	  specify host/port combinations to ignore

	- 587/tcp is now recognized as another SMTP port, and 7000/tcp as
	  a popular IRC port ignored by default

	- brolite-backdoor.bro is a sample of using backdoor.bro

- A bunch of enhancements and fixes for the IRC backdoor detector
  (Vern Paxson).

- The cf utility in aux/cf/ now gets the format to use (unless you specify
  -f fmt) from $CFTIMEFMT in the environment.  You can now specify -f
  without a format to revert to the default format.  This change also
  includes a significant performance improvement when processing large
  files (Mark Dedlow and Craig Leres).

- Cleanups for brolite.bro and brolite-backdoor.bro (Brian Tierney).
  brolite.bro now uses rotate-logs by default.

- backdoor.bro now enables analysis of partial connections (Vern Paxson).

- brolite config cleanup: removed smtp.bro from default, increased
  max_timer_expires, changed default BROPATH to look at site dir
  first (Brian Tierney).

- The reference manual has been updated for the terminology changes
  of log -> alarm, alert -> notice, and rule -> signature (Vern Paxson).
  Some vestiges of the older terminology remain, in part because they're
  still present in some facets of Bro.

- The new script function get_current_packet(): pcap_packet returns
  the current packet as a "pcap_packet" record with fields $ts_sec,
  $ts_usec, $caplen, $len (all of type count) and $data (a string)
  reflecting the corresponding libpcap values (Christian Kreibich).
  You can write this packet to a dump file using the new function
  dump_packet(pkt: pcap_packet, file_name: string): bool, which writes
  (or appends) the packet to a file of the given name, returning T
  on success and F on error.

- The new fmt() specifier 'T'  converts values of type "time" to ISO
  format timestamps, analogous to how 'D' does this for ISO dates
  (Mark Dedlow).  fmt("%T", <time>) is equivalent to
  fmt("%s", strftime("%F-%T.%N", <time>)), except that strftime
  does not (yet) offer "%N" for nanoseconds (but see 'date +%F-%T.%N').

- The new %S format for fmt() inserts a "raw" version of the given string -
  that is, embedded NULs, control characters, etc., are present without
  any escaping (Christian Kreibich).

- Zero-padding and field widths now work for all fmt() formats rather than
  just %e/%f/%g (Christian Kreibich).   For example, you can now say:

	local filename = fmt("log-%04.txt", ++counter);

  and get logfiles log-0001.txt, log-0002.txt, ..., log-0999.txt, etc.

- The 'x' format specifier now supports values of type "addr", converting
  them t hex (Mark Dedlow).  For example,

	  fmt("str=%s hex=%x", 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.4)

  produces

	str=1.2.3.4 hex=01020304

  The field designation is either %08x (if compiled for IPv4 only) or
  %08x%08x%08x%08x (if compiled with IPv6 support).

- firewall.bro has been extended to support multiple independent
  rule-sets (by calling begin() for the start of the next one),
  specifying sets of addresses, being FTP-aware, and with a more
  streamlined Notice message (Robin Sommer).

- The HTTP script variables maintain_http_sessions and http_sessions
  are now exported so they can be redefined or, for the latter, have
  timeouts added/adjusted (Robin Sommer).

- You can load the new policy script log-append.bro to change Bro's
  behavior so that when it runs appends to existing log files rather
  than overwriting them (Mark Dedlow).

- New &disable_print_hook attribute for files (Robin Sommer).  If set,
  print statements to the file don't trigger the print_hook event.  This
  is useful to keep the output of certain files from being propagated to
  peers.

- You can now associate "classes" with remote peers (Robin Sommer).  When
  connecting, a node may send a specific class to which it considers itself
  belonging. The accepting side can then tune its configuration based on
  the received class.

  This is primarily for the having multiple unrelated Broccolis running on the
  same host, all connecting to the same remote Bro (e.g., sshd and syslog
  sensors).

  To use this, on the Bro side the record Remote::Destination now has a
  field "class: string" (default: unset).  If set, the given config entry
  only applies for connecting remote peers that send the given class.
  If it is set and we're connecting to another peer, we propagate the class.

  Example:

      On the listening Bro:

	    redef Remote::destinations += {
		["peer-1"] =
			[$host = 127.0.0.1, $class="ftp", $events = /ftp.*/],
	        ["peer-2"] =
			[$host = 127.0.0.1, $class="http", $events = /http.*/]
	    };

      On peer 1:

	    redef Remote::destinations += {
		  ["master"] =
			[$host = 127.0.0.1, $class="ftp",
			 $events = /.*/, $connect=T]
	    };

      On peer 2:

	    redef Remote::destinations += {
		  ["master"] =
			[$host = 127.0.0.1, $class="http",
			 $events = /.*/, $connect=T]
	    };

  All of these may run on the same host.

- A bunch of changes to adu.bro (Christian Kreibich):

	- New ADU_MAX_DEPTH limits depth (at ADU granularity) into a
	  flow up to which ADUs are reported.

	- Handles UDP.

	- New event adu_done(c: connection) signals that no further ADUs
	  will be delivered for a connection.  This is useful since adu.bro
	  relies on event connection_state_remove() to remove state, and
	  if a policy using adu.bro likewise uses this event type then
	  event sequencing can cause adu_tx/rx events to occur after
	  connection_state_remove() has been processed.

	- Now correctly clips ADU to maximum allowed size.  (Note, this
	  has been temporarily commented out because it relies on a new
	  string function that has not yet been integrated into the
	  main distribution.)

	- Now can ignore specific connections dynamically.

	- TCP content gaps are now recognized and ADU delivery is for now
	  stopped for such flows, unless explicitly requested.

	- No longer logs to file in test mode.

- The new function add_notice_tag() explicitly adds a unique notice tag
  to a connection's $addl field (Robin Sommer).  This is sometimes necessary
  to ensure that the tag appears in the connection summary.

- Bro now performs serialization (such as when checkpointing &persistent
  tables or communicating them between Bro's) in an incremental fashion,
  intermingling transfers of large tables with ongoing packet processing
  (Robin Sommer).  Doing so helps avoid packet drops for large items.
  This has not yet been implemented for the initial handshake done
  for &synchronized items.

- ssl.bro now stores certificates by default in the subdirectory "certs/"
  (Robin Sommer).

- Analysis of weak/unknown ciphersuites in ssl.bro reworked (Holger Dreger).

- New cipher for SSL analysis, SSL_CK_RC4_64_WITH_MD5 (Holger Dreger).

- load-levels and cpu-adapt now log their adaptations to the log file
  rather than generating alarms (Robin Sommer).

- The default adaptation levels in cpu-adapt have been tweaked for better
  behavior (Robin Sommer).

- A new structure of the event loop (implemented by Robin Sommer) is now
  enabled during configuration by default (Christian Kreibich).  You can
  revert to the previous structure using --disable-select-loop.

- When configuring Bro, the version of pcap that comes with the Bro
  distribution is no longer used by default (Jason Lee).  Instead,
  the system one is used, or one at the same directory level as Bro.
  To use the Bro distribution version, configure with --enable-shippedpcap.

- backdoor.bro now has comments clarifying that it does not itself
  alter capture_filters (Vern Paxson).

- If you set backdoor_stat_period to 0 sec, then this now turns off
  the periodic component of backdoor analysis (Holger Dreger).

- The filters specified in notice_action_filters now take an additional
  argument specifying the action that has been determined so far (Robin
  Sommer).  This allows the filter to decide to not change the current
  action, if it so wishes.

- The new event notice_alarm(n: notice_info, action: NoticeAction) is
  generated for every notice that results in an alarm (Robin Sommer).

- Tallying of notices is now done using a notice, which has type NoticeTally
  (Robin Sommer).

- The new notice action filter alarm_always_notice specifies an action
  of NOTICE_ALARM_ALWAYS (Vern Paxson).

- If the watchdog expires and Bro isn't generating a packet trace file,
  the current packet is saved to "watchdog-pkt.pcap" (Robin Sommer).

- New boolean globals tcp_contents_deliver_all_{orig,resp} allow easy
  requesting of content delivery for all TCP traffic in orig/resp directions
  (Christian Kreibich).

- The new event udp_contents(u: connection, is_orig: bool, contents: string)
  delivers the contents of UDP packets analogous to tcp_contents (Christian
  Kreibich).  The boolean globals udp_content_deliver_all_{orig,resp} and
  tables udp_content_delivery_ports_{orig,resp} control for which ports
  content is delivered, analogous to the globals that control tcp_contents.

- New option --set-seed=n sets the random number seed to n (Vern Paxson).

- Notices now report current time for remotely-received notices rather
  than network time (Brian Tierney).

- Notices now include a tag es=<peer_description> any time a peer
  description is defined, not just for remote notices (Robin Sommer).

- The global log_as_connection has been removed from icmp.bro, which now
  only logs ICMP flows via the usual connection logging (Vern Paxson).

- The Destination variable $accept_state has been renamed $accept_input
  to better reflect its meaning (Vern Paxson).

- A remote destination's $sync field now indicates whether to accept
  ongoing state changes from peers, rather than just upon start-up
  (Robin Sommer).  The variable $accept_state controls whether we
  accept events.

- Logging of forms of Bro communication has been unified (Robin Sommer).

- Updates for packet filtering documentation (Christian Kreibich).

- A new global, stp_skip_src, lists sources that should be skipped for
  stepping-stone analysis (Vern Paxson).  ssh-stepping.bro adds sources to
  this list if they've instantiated more than src_fanout_no_stp_analysis_thresh
  connections, keeping them blocked until they've been idle for 15 seconds.

- Added a default notice-policy.bro as an example (Brian Tierney).

- Expanded on descriptive text in notice-policy.bro (Vern Paxson).

- ef removed from aux/hf/, as it's of little use and a headache to
  maintain for portability (Vern Paxson).

- The version of libpcap bundled with the distribution has been
  elevated to 0.8.3 (Jason Lee).

- Bro now compiles again if non-blocking DNS is not available (Robin Sommer).

- Resource statistics logging now differentiates between offline
  processing vs. remote-communication-only (Mark Dedlow and Robin Sommer).

- The script variable ICMP::distinct_pairs now times out its state,
  with a default of 15 minutes after creation (Robin Sommer).

- The Bro version reported now includes "-debug" if Bro was configured
  with --enable-debug (Robin Sommer).

- scan.bro now defaults "shut_down_all_scans" to T, meaning it by
  default detects scans on all ports, not just those in the set
  shut_down_scans (Vern Paxson).  Please note, this variable is
  misnamed - it should be "detect_all_scans" - but that change is
  waiting on reworking the basic structure of scan detection.

- Major bug fix for signature matcher missing matches on analyzer data
  (Robin Sommer).  For example, a condition "http /foo/" would only have
  match with the first URL in a connection, not subsequent ones.  Fixing
  this changes the calling sequence of the match_signatures() built-in to
  take an additional final parameter, "clear", which, if set, resets the
  matcher to its starting state prior to matching.

- Serious bug in regular expression matching - and hence signature engine -
  fixed (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for formatting (via fmt()) of very long strings (Vern Paxson).

- Fixed mail_reports.sh to correctly find sendmail binary on various systems
  (Brian Tierney).

- Numerous changes to Bro's internal string representation, and more
  flexibility in how strings are rendered for display (Christian Kreibich).

- Pseudo-real-time now can be initialized using an optional argument
  that corresponds to the degree of time compression (Robin Sommer).
  For example, --pseudo-realtime=0.5 causes time to advance half as fast
  as it would in real-time.  The default value is 1.0; any value > 0 is
  allowed.

- The SSH analyzer now looks for just linefeeds as line terminators when
  extracting version strings, rather than carriage-return-line-feeds, to
  match actual implementations rather than the RFC (suggested by Chema
  Gonzalez).

- Playing back events from files now working again (Robin Sommer).

- Bro now uses current_time() rather than network_time to track the
  modification time of variables, since network_time doesn't advance
  when only receiving events (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fixes for IPv6 support, including processing UDP traffic
  (which had been completely broken) and subtle interactions (actually,
  lack thereof) between the connection compressor and IPv6 that
  could lead to crashes (Vern Paxson).

- Portability tweaks for NetBSD, 64-bit Linux SuSe and FreeBSD 5.4
  (Christian Kreibich, Jason Lee and Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for IPv6 "::" constants that start with hex digits specified
  using 0x (Vern Paxson).

- Calling the built-in terminate() function twice now has no additional
  effect (Christian Kreibich).  It used to terminate Bro abruptly, without
  cleanly shutting down.

- Removed active.bro; use active_connection() + connection_record() instead
  (Vern Paxson).

- Bro lite reports now work with rotated logs files (Brian Tierney)

- Bug fix for conditions such as "payload /^user/", which now work equivalent
  to "payload /user/" (Robin Sommer).

- Tweaks to sensitive patterns in HTTP request URIs to reduce false
  positives (Brian Tierney).

- Bug fixes for strip() built-in function (Holger Dreger).

- Memory leak in built-in function to_addr() fixed (Ruoming Pang).

- Bug fix for "hot" connections sometimes not having their notice tag
  appearing in connection summaries (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fixes for IRC analysis (Vern Paxson and Robin Sommer).

- Syslogging now works if Bro is running in communication-only mode
  i.e., live, but not reading a network interface (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix to allow tuning of TRW parameters (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fixes for SSL analysis (Holger Dreger).

- Removed logic that inverted orig/resp in some scans (Vern Paxson).

- Lint & memory allocation tweaks (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fixes for inactivity timeouts (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for Bro Lite cron job (Jason Lee).

- When binding to a listening port for remote communication fails,
  the port number is now reported (Robin Sommer).

- Some spurious reporting removed from configure output (Jason Lee).

- Fix for "weird"'s generated by connection compressor but not
  recognized at the policy script level (Vern Paxson).

- Fixes for detecting content gaps and not matching previously delivered
  data (Ruoming Pang).

- Bug fixes for TCP rewriter (Ruoming Pang).

- Bug fixes for crashes in SSL analyzer (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for avoiding busy-waiting when a communication child dies
  (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for BiF's that use 'T' and 'F' in character constants
  (Vern Paxson).

- Memory leak fixes (Robin Sommer, Christian Kreibich, Vern Paxson and
  Ruoming Pang).

- The peer table for inter-Bro communication is now correctly indexed by a
  peer_id (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for exchange of initial &synchronized state which could
  prevent communication from entering main phase (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for propagating incremented table values derived from
  a table's &default (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fixes for the POP3 analyzer when analyzing non-NUL-terminated strings
  or bad base64 encodings (Vern Paxson).

- Updates for Bro's internal hash functions (Ruoming Pang).

- The debug and communication log files now comply with $BRO_LOG_SUFFIX
  (Robin Sommer).

- Some internal debugging additions (Ruoming Pang).

- Internal cleanup regarding "const" strings (Ruoming Pang).

- A number of casts changed to use modern C++-style pointer casting
  such as reinterpret_cast and static_cast (Ruoming Pang).

- Bug fixes for inter-Bro communication on 64-bit systems (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fixes for detecting errors for SSL connections (Robin Sommer).

- Potential null pointer dereference fixed (Robin Sommer).

- Inter-Bro communication is now more reliable in the presence of errors
  (Robin Sommer).

- Performance enhancement for tracking values whose elements might
  change (Robin Sommer).

- Fixes for peers having differing enum lists (Robin Sommer).  This can
  occur because they're running different scripts and which do different
  redef +='s to add enum values.

- += now works for interval types (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for exchanging peer descriptions (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for processing multipart-MIME HTTP messages with content-length
  headers (Ruoming Pang).

- Bug fix for failing to escape "'s in HTTP server replies (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for propagating increment operations on tables (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fixes for files (Robin Sommer): set open time to current time if
  network time is not initialized; when deserializing files, prevent them
  from being closed immediately due to reference-counting interaction.

- Bug fix to prevent reporting some scans twice (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for printing enum's (Christian Kreibich).

  with an input source (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for which process ID to check to see if children are still alive
  (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix for no longer crashing if the expiration function associated
  with a table deletes the element from the table rather than returning
  an interval of 0 secs to indicate it should be deleted (Chema Gonzalez).

- Bug fix for OutboundTFTP notice: now checks to ensure that not only is
  the source local, but the destination is not local (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for a subtle interaction mediated by errno, which could cause a
  failed read() to later confuse pcap_dispatch() (Chema Gonzalez).

- Bug fix for TCP contents assertion checking (Ruoming Pang).

- Bug fix for error output on small RPC fragments (Ruoming Pang).

- Fix for connection compressor bug in tracking connection history

  beyond the end of a list (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fix in initializing capabilities when setting up communication between
  Bro peers (Robin Sommer).

- A number of connection compressor bug fixes: weird's for spontaneous

1.0 Sun Oct 23 17:27:45 PDT 2005

- Bro now includes BinPAC (Binary Protocol Analyzer Compiler), a language
  and compiler for automating the construction of analyzers for binary
  protocols (Ruoming Pang).

- Ruoming has used BinPAC to rewrite the analyzers for DCE/RPC (with
  significant enhancements, including adding the endpoing mapper) and SMB
  (likewise enhanced and bug-fixed), and creating a new analyzer for NCP
  (Netware Core Protocol).  The NCP analyzer generates two events:

	ncp_request(c: connection, frame_type: count, length: count,
			func: count)

	ncp_reply(c: connection, frame_type: count, length: count,
			req_frame: count, req_func: count,
			completion_code: count)

- The beginnings of an analyzer for NetBIOS name service (Ruoming Pang).
  It generates the following events:

	event nbns_standard_name_query(c: connection)
	event nbns_nbstat_query(c: connection)
	event nbns_name_reg_request(c: connection)
	event nbns_nb_name_query(c: connection)

- New IRC analyzer (Roland Gruber).  It generates a lot of events; see
  policy/irc.bro.  Note, the formatting of the log file will at some point
  be changed to be more uniform and streamlined.

- ICMP events now include an initial parameter of type "connection",
  the same as for TCP & UDP flows (Ruoming Pang).  This facilitates
  traffic analysis by associating generic connection events such as
  connection_state_remove with ICMP events.  This affects:

	event icmp_sent(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn)
	event icmp_echo_request(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn,
			id: count, seq: count, payload: string)
	event icmp_echo_reply(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn, id: count,
			seq: count, payload: string)
	event icmp_unreachable(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn,
			code: count, context: icmp_context)
	event icmp_time_exceeded(c: connection, icmp: icmp_conn,
			code: count, context: icmp_context)

- New POP3 analyzer (Florian Schimandl, Hugh Dollman and Robin Sommer).
  Loading pop3.bro analyzes the protocol messages, and loading mime-pop.bro
  also extracts the email headers and content.

- New events (Ruoming Pang):

	connection_first_ACK(c: connection)
		generated upon the ACK completing a TCP handshake. Useful
		in detecting "blink scans" (a FIN coming from the client
		right after the ACK)

	tcp_rexmit(c: connection, is_orig: bool, seq: count, len: count,
			data_in_flight: count, window: count)
		generated when a TCP sender retransmits data

	rpc_call(c: connection, prog: count, ver: count, proc: count,
			status: count, start_time: time,
			call_len: count, reply_len: count)
		can be used to process RPC calls in a generic fashion

	nfs_reply_status(n: connection, status: count)
		supplies the status of NFS server replies

	netbios_session_raw_message(c: connection, is_orig: bool, msg: string)
		access to a NetBIOS SSN message in raw terms

	smb_get_dfs_referral(c: connection, max_referral_level: count,
				file_name: string)
		generated for SMB DFS referal requests

	dns_message(c: connection, is_orig: bool, msg: dns_msg, len: count)
		low-level event generated for each DNS request/reponse

	dce_rpc_bind(c: connection, uuid: string)
		generated for DCE RPC binds

	dce_rpc_message(c: connection, is_orig: bool, ptype: dce_rpc_ptype,
			msg: string)
		low-level access to DCE RPC messages; see const.bif for
		dce_rpc_ptype values

	epm_map_response(c: connection, uuid: string, p: port, h: addr)
		reply from DCE portmapper

- New operator |x|, a sizeof operator (Christian Kreibich).  It yields
  absolute values for numerical values, file size for files, the number
  of enums for an enum type, the number of addresses in subnets, number
  of fields in records, numeric equivalent for addresses, the number of
  elements in vectors/sets/tables, and the length of strings.

- A new clone operator, "* <expr>", produces deep copies of aggregate
  values and the usual duplicates for atomic ones (Christian Kreibich).
  For example, while:

	   1	type foo: record {
	   2		c: count;
	   3		s: string;
	   4	};
	   5
	   6	f1$c = 10;
	   7	f1$s = "Hello";
	   8
	   9	f2 = f1;
	   10	f1$c = 20;
	   11	f1$s = "World";
	   12
	   13	print fmt("%d/%s %d/%s", f1$c, f1$s, f2$c, f2$s);

  yields "20/World 20/World", changing line 9 to:

	f2 = *f1;

  yields "20/World 10/Hello".

- New operators "+=" and "-=", which work on both numerical values and
  strings (Christian Kreibich).

- "+" now works on strings: s1 + s2 yields the concatenation of both
  (Christian Kreibich).

- You can now express the equivalent of ICMP "port numbers" using
  <number>/icmp, where <number> is the ICMP type (Ruoming Pang).

- Bro now accepts long versions of options, such as --readfile for -r
  (Christian Kreibich).

- Bro now has a "pseudo-realtime" mode, activated by --pseudo-realtime,
  that causes it to mimic real-time operation when executing against
  a trace (Robin Sommer).  This is useful for evaluating performance in
  a controlled fashion.

- SMTP analyzer changes (Roger Winslow): support for 554 code in RCPT
  responses; logging when the server refuses the argument to RCPT;
  support for 502 code in response to a HELP command.

- Addition of two universal hash functions: H3 (from David Moore, based
  on code by Ken Keys) and TwoWise (Dietzfelbinger, from Yin Zhang)
  (Ruoming Pang).  Use --enable-h3 and --enable-dietzfelbinger to enable
  them (used as the hash function for short data).  H3 is used by default.

- The "bif" compiler for compiling Bro built-in functions now supports
  an "enum" type (Ruoming Pang).  The syntax is:

	enum dce_rpc_ptype
	%{
		DCE_RPC_REQUEST,
		DCE_RPC_PING,
		DCE_RPC_RESPONSE,
	%}

  which is translated to an enum declaration of "dce_rpc_ptype" in
  Bro, an EnumType* enum_dce_rpc_ptype in NetVar.{h,cc} and a C++ enum
  BroEnum::dce_rpc_ptype {...}.

  One limitation is that redef's on enum types cannot be taken into
  account because the bif is parsed at compile time.

- 64-bit integer support via --enable-int64 (Ruoming Pang).

- The new, experimental policy script adu.bro provides a generic way to
  extract application-layer ADUs (Christian Kreibich).  It heuristicly
  groups blocks of content sent from one side to another, uninterrupted
  by any data in the opposite direction, into an approximate ADU (request
  or reply).  These then generate adu_tx (originator -> responder) and
  adu_rx (responder -> originator) events.  You can control on which ports
  it does this analysis, as well as the amount of data inspected nad
  grouped, using variables documented in the script.

- The new built-in function

	function str_smith_waterman(s1: string, s2: string, params: sw_params)
	: sw_substring_vec

  computes the Smith-Waterman overlap between two strings (Christian Kreibich).
  The third parameter is a record with two fields, $min_toklen (minimum
  length for common tokens) and $sw_variant, which takes a value of 0
  for single-matching and 1 for multiple-matching.

  The return value is a vector of sw_substring records, which hold the
  following fields:

	str: string;	# the common subsequence
	index1: count;	# where it occurs in input string 1
	index2: count;	# where it occurs in input string 2
	new: bool;	# true if start of new alignment

- If you set the new control variable record_state_history to T, then
  connections recorded to the conn.$BRO_LOG_SUFFIX log file will include
  a field that shows the different states encountered during the connection
  (Mark Allman):

	Symbol	State
	------	-----
	S	Initial SYN seen for TCP connection.
	H	SYN-ACK seen for TCP connection.
	D	Data packet seen (TCP or UDP).
	A	Pure ACK seen for TCP connection.
	F	FIN seen for TCP connection.
	R	RST seen for TCP connection.
	I	TCP connection included a FIN+RST packet.
	Q	TCP connection included a packet with multiple connection
		control flags other than FIN+RST (e.g., SYN+RST).
	C	Connection included one or more packets with failed checksums
		(TCP or UDP).

  The symbols are printed in upper-case for connection originators and
  lower-case for responders.  The S/H/F/R symbols are also repeated if
  Bro sees the corresponding control packet subsequently with a different
  sequence number.

  For example, a TCP connection which Bro saw from the beginning, i.e.,
  a normal establishment, followed by the client (originator) first sending
  data, then the server responding, followed by the server initiating a
  normal close which the client then completes, will be annotated as
  "ShADadfF".

- The "for" looping construct now can be used to iterate over the non-empty
  indices of a vector (Christian Kreibich).

- If you set the new variable skip_http_data to T (default: F), then the
  HTTP analyzer will attempt to not reassemble the data portions of HTTP
  request/responses (Ruoming Pang).  This can be a performance benefit
  in environments with high volumes of HTTP traffic, though it may not be
  a large win if the processing is dominated by executing the policy script.

- The new built-in

	remask_addr(a1: addr, a2: addr, top_bits_from_a1: count): addr

  take some top bits (e.g. subnet address) from a1 and remaining bits
  (intra-subnet part) from a2 and merge them to get a new address (Ruoming
  Pang).  Useful for anonymizing at the subnet level while preserving
  serial scans.

- The new built-in

	decode_netbios_name(name: string): string

  takes a string in NetBIOS encoding and returns its original form
  (Ruoming Pang).

- The new variable ignore_keep_alive_rexmit controls whether to
  include keep-alives when counting retransmitted packets (Ruoming Pang).
  It defaults to F (i.e., do count them).

- The calling sequence of dce_rpc_request and dce_rpc_reply have changed to:

	event dce_rpc_request(c: connection, opnum: count, stub: string)
	event dce_rpc_response(c: connection, opnum: count, stub: string)

  (Ruoming Pang).  Use dce_rpc_message to get access to the RPC type and
  the raw message.

- The calling sequence of the netbios_session_message event has changed to:

	netbios_ssn_message(c: connection, is_orig: bool,
				msg_type: count, data_len: count)

  (Ruoming Pang).  Previously it was parameterized with the connection
  and the raw message (now available via netbios_session_raw_message).

- The calling sequences of smb_com_{read,write}_andx have changed to
  no longer include the is_orig parameter because it is in fact fixed for
  these events (Ruoming Pang).

- The calling sequence of smb_message has changed (Ruoming Pang) to:

	smb_message(c: connection, is_orig: bool, cmd: string,
			body_length: count)

- Bug fix specifying the &default value for tables that yield function
  values (Ruoming Pang).  For example:

	type tcp_content_handler_func:
		function (c: connection, is_orig: bool, seq: count,
				contents: string);

	function default_tcp_content_handler(c: connection, is_orig: bool,
						seq: count, contents: string)
		{
		# do something ...
		}

	const tcp_content_orig_handlers: table[port] of
		tcp_content_handler_func = {} &redef &default =
			default_tcp_content_handler;

  Previously, Bro would take the function given with &default as the default
  function to call when accessing a missing element, rather than a default
  *value* to directly return. Bro now checks the value type against the
  function type to see if they match in type.

- The new variables forward_remote_events and forward_remote_state_changes
  specify whether to broadcast events/state received from one peer to other
  peers (Robin Sommer).  Both default to F.  Note, these options are temporary;
  they will disappear when we add a more sophisticated script-level
  communication framework.

- Vectors can now be initialized using the syntax such as

	global foo: vector of string = ["foo","bar"];

  (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fixes for &synchronize'ing vectors (Robin Sommer).

- The internal implementation of strings in the policy language has
  been heavily revamped (Christian Kreibich).

- String built-in functions are now in strings.bif rather than bro.bif
  (Christian Kreibich).  This includes two new built-ins:

	str_split(s: string, idx: index_vec): string_vec
	strstr(big: string, little: string): count

  string_vec is a new policy script type that is an alias for
  "vector of string".

- The new options --load-seeds <file> and --save-seeds <file> let you
  record Bro's seeds to a file and then re-use these seeds in a later
  invocation (Christian Kreibich). The primary intended usage is to
  provide determinism in hash table iterations etc. for debugging purposes.

- Communication protocol changes (Robin Sommer):

  * Internal PING/PONG messages to measure round-trip times.  The new script
    remote-ping.bro issues PINGs every second and logs to remote.log.

  * Optional data compression if libz is available.  Remote::Peer$compression
    specifies compression level, with no compression being the default.

  * Inter-Bro communication is now performed in four explicit phases:

    //  Setup:
    //      Initial phase.
    //      VERSION messages must be exchanged.
    //      Ends when both peers have sent VERSION.
    //  Handshake:
    //      REQUEST_EVENTS/REQUEST_SYNC/CAPTURE_FILTER/CAPS/selected SERIALs
    //        may be exchanged.
    //      Phase ends when both peers have sent PHASE_DONE.
    //  State synchronization:
    //      Entered iff at least one of the peers has sent REQUEST_SYNC.
    //      The peer with the smallest runtime (incl. in VERSION msg) sends
    //        SERIAL messages comprising all of its state.
    //      Phase ends when peer sends another PHASE_DONE.
    //  Running:
    //      Peers exchange SERIAL (and PING/PONG) messages.
    //      Phase ends with connection tear-down by one of the peers.

  * Serializing network packets includes textual tags for identification.

  * Serializing files includes the state of buffering.

- Pending events for remote peers are now flushed when Bro terminates,
  and the net_done event is *not* propagated to peers (Robin Sommer).

- Makefile.am cleanups (Christian Kreibich).

0.9a10 Tue Sep  6 10:41:53 PDT 2005

- Fixes for portability to 64-bit architectures (Christian Kreibich).

- Bug fix for broken syslog'ing of alarms (Scott Campbell).

- The manual has been updated to clarify that aggregate values in events
  are passed as shallow copies, so that modifications to elements of the
  values after posting the event but before it's handled will be visible
  to the handlers for the events (Christian Kreibich).

- HTTP logging now includes the host from the Host header in the request
  (Craig Leres).  Note, currenty this only is done when using http-reply.bro,
  not if you only analyze requests.

- You can now specify a passphrase for the SSL cert used for inter-Bro
  communication by redef'ing the variaable "ssl_passphrase" (Christian
  Kreibich).  Leaving it unchanged causes the passphrase to be read
  interactively.

- Certificates created using ca-issue now have 2-year lifetimes rather
  than the default of 30 days (Christian Kreibich).

- A problem with handshaking between Bro peers has been fixed (Christian
  Kreibich).

- A bug has been fixed in scanning false positives due to backscatter
  in the form of SYN ACKs (Vern Paxson).

- Alerts sent via email now use a From address configured from bro.cfg
  (Randy Mcclelland-Bane).  Also, if sending an alert via gpg fails,
  it's sent instead as plaintext.

- Scan notices now include information about the connection that
  triggered the scan detection decision (Vern Paxson).

- Exported some TRW variables so the user can adjust their associated
  timers (Vern Paxson).

- The new script variable dns_max_queries sets a maximum on the number of
  queries that can appear in a DNS request (Scott Campbell & Vern Paxson).
  If more queries appear, the request is treated as non-DNS traffic and
  ignored.  The variable defaults to a value of 5.  Setting it to 0 turns
  off this functionality, so Bro processes all apparent requests.

- The "weird" messages generated by the DNS analyzer now have a more
  regular naming structure and processing (Scott Campbell and Vern Paxson).

- Tweaked bif_arg.cc to pass gcc4.0 and bro.bif to not collide with
  uuid in OSX 10.4 (Jason Lee).  Now works on OSX 10.4, though use
  --disable-localpcap when compiling.

- Bro now compiles cleanly under OpenBSD (Jason Lee).

- NOTE: the connection compressor has a known serious bug and should
  not be used at present.  Since it is an experimental feature, fixing it
  is deferred to the next release.

- Some bugs fixed in the management of hash keys when using the
  connection compressor (Robin Sommer).

- Tweak for the connection compressor to generate truncated_header weird's
  (Robin Sommer).

- Temporary bug fix for type clash in SSL version numbers (Vern Paxson)
  by making them consistently of type int.  The correct fix is probably
  for them to be consistently of type count, depending on how Bro's notion
  of general version processing, and its SSL analyzer, both evolve.

- Bug fix for trace rewriting failing if Bro was not compiled to check
  assertions (Martin Casado).

- Fixed logic bug in signal handling regarding whether we're currently
  idle waiting for input vs. processing a packet or the event queue
  (Vern Paxson).  Note, this change has not been heavily tested.

- Some bug fixes for correct operation when DNS names fail to resolve
  (Vern Paxson).  It's not clear that these fixes are complete, however.

- Fixed to not compile libpcap when --disable-localpcap is given to configure
  (Jason Lee).

- Fixed configuration of local pcap for IPv6 if --enable-brov6 is specified
  (Jason Lee).

- A problem with "make install" when building from the libpcap included
  in the sources has been fixed (Christian Kreibich).


0.9a9 Thu May 19 23:31:33 PDT 2005

- First cut at analyzer for NFS (Vern Paxson).  It generates the following
  events:
	event nfs_request_null(n: connection)
	event nfs_request_getattr(n: connection, fh: string, attrs: nfs3_attrs)
	event nfs_request_lookup(n: connection, req: nfs3_lookup_args,
				rep: nfs3_lookup_reply)
	event nfs_request_fsstat(n: connection, root_fh: string,
				stat: nfs3_fsstat)
	event nfs_attempt_null(n: connection, status: count)
	event nfs_attempt_getattr(n: connection, status: count, fh: string)
	event nfs_attempt_lookup(n: connection, status: count,
				req: nfs3_lookup_args,
				dir_attrs: nfs3_opt_attrs)
	event nfs_attempt_fsstat(n: connection, status: count,
				root_fh: string, obj_attrs: nfs3_opt_attrs)

- The new script OS-fingerprint.bro integrates Bro's new passive OS
  fingerprinting mechanism with the software.bro framework (Vern Paxson).

- You can now operate on patterns using && and || (Vern Paxson).
  If p1 and p2 are patterns, then p1 && p2 yields a pattern that matches
  their concatenation and p1 || p2 yields a pattern that matches either.
  Note that the syntax for this may change in the future to a single '&'
  or '|', which would be more consistent with the use of '|' in
  constructing pattern constants.

- An experimental "connection compressor" tracks not-yet-established
  connections using much less memory than Bro normally does (Robin Sommer).
  This is potentially a major win during flooding attacks and high-speed
  scans.  You activate it by setting use_connection_compressor to T.  You
  can then control the granularity of its processing using the variables
  cc_handle_resets, cc_handle_only_syns, and cc_instantiate_on_data.  See
  bro.init for brief discussion of these.

- The experimental new script firewall.bro supports firewall-rule-like
  processing of connections in terms of allow/deny (Robin Sommer).  It is
  not particularly efficient.

- sensor-sshd.bro provides an experimental interface for receiving
  events from instrumented SSH servers that communicate with Bro via
  the Broccoli client library (Christian Kreibich and Robin Sommer).
  Supporting this also entailed extensions to login.bro so it can
  process the events even though they don't correspond to a connection
  known to Bro's event engine.

- The new built-in function match_signatures() can be used in a policy
  script to send text directly into the signature engine (Robin Sommer).

- Correction: the 0.9a8 CHANGES states that the mail_script variable used
  for NOTICE_EMAIL defaults to mail_script.sh.  The correct value is instead
  "mail_notice.sh".

- The scripts rsh.bro and passwords.bro, and the passive-fingerprinting
  signatures policy/sigs/p0fsyn.osf were inadvertantly left out of the
  0.9a8 distribution.

- Added s2b (snort to bro) files into the distribution. (Jason Lee)

- Non-blocking packet capture under Linux has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- Fixed printing of DNS replies, which used to work but was broken
  a number of months ago (Vern Paxson).

- The new script brolite-sigs separates out how signatures are configured
  in Bro Lite so the functionality can be enabled/disabled with a simple
  load statement (Roger Winslow).  That is, to use signatures with Bro
  lite, simply add "@load brolite-sigs".

- The new script variable enable_syslog (default T) controls whether
  alarm's are syslog'd (Robin Sommer).  As before, syslogs can only happen
  when Bro is reading from live network traffic (this should be changed
  at some point, to accommodate real-time Bro's that don't read the network
  but collect events from other sensors).  Previously, in that case syslog's
  always happened; now, you can turn them off using this variable.

- The new script variable expensive_profiling_multiple controls how
  often, when doing profiling, to perform more expensive forms of
  profiling, in particular, memory consumption profiling (Robin Sommer).
  If profiling_interval is set to 15 sec and expensive_profiling_multiple
  is set to 20, then expensive profiling will be done every 5 minutes
  (these are the defaults now in profiling.bro).  Also, the profiling_update
  event now includes a second argument, expensive: bool, which indicates
  whether the update corresponds to one of these expensive profiling
  intervals.

- First cut at parsing DNS AAAA replies (Scott Campbell).  This is quite
  incomplete - currently, the replies are turned into fake A record replies,
  due to the difficulty of dealing with IPv6 addresses if Bro wasn't built
  to analyze IPv6 traffic.

- software.bro has been tweaked to have a new control variable,
  "only_report_local" (default F).  If true, then only software versions
  for local addresses (as determined by is_local_addr()) will be
  reported.

- synflood.bro now has a script variable max_sources (default 100) that
  specifies the maximum number of sources to track for a given victim
  (Robin Sommer).

- Remote peers now negotiate their versions of the serialization format
  (Robin Sommer). If they don't agree then the connection is terminated.

- Generic UDP request/response processing has been moved into the new
  policy script udp-common.bro, which, unlike udp.bro, does *not* set the
  packet filter to capture all UDP traffic (Robin Sommer).  A number
  of UDP-based policy scripts have been modified to use udp-common.bro
  rather than udp.bro.

- When printing serialized/independent state, access times are now
  again included (Robin Sommer).

- Bro's implementation of timers has been switched (reverted) to using
  priority queues (Vern Paxson).

- The http-request.bro script variables skip_remote_sensitive_URIs and
  const sensitive_post_URIs are now exported so they can be accessed
  externally (Robin Sommer).

- Some new rootkit filenames have been added to ftp.bro and
  http-request.bro (Brian Tierney).  The plan is to eventually
  merge these lists so there's only one main list.

- trw.bro is now scoped as a module "TRW" (Brian Tierney).

- Better support of the '--disable-localpcap' flag to configure, and
  consolidated all the pcap checks in configure.in (Jason Lee).

- A bug in processing bare carriage-returns in Telnet input/output
  has been fixed (Vern Paxson).

- The Bro Lite bro.rc script has been tweaked to use the 'ax' flags
  instead of '-ax' (Jason Lee).

- A bug with reporting ICMP "ports" (i.e., type + code) has been fixed
  (Vern Paxson).

- Bug fix for excessively large RPC messages (Ruoming Pang).

- A bug with /0 subnet prefixes has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- The function record_connection() now takes the file to write to
  as its first argument (Robin Sommer).

- remote.bro now tracks whether a given Destination is connected
  (Robin Sommer).

- mail_notice.sh is now installed as part of installing a distribution
  (Jason Lee).

- Fixed bug where the sort order for the test suite changed depending
  on locale. (Jason Lee)

- Bug fix for email_notice() when notice_action_filters not defined for
  given notice (Vern Paxson).

- The test suite test for rare-events fixed to not give false positives
  (Jason Lee).

- Date added for 0.9a8 release.


0.9a8 Wed Feb 16 17:09:34 PST 2005

- aux/rst/ contains the source for the "rst" tool used by Bro (via the
  policy script function terminate_connection() in conn.bro) to tear
  down established connections by forging RST packets.

- Bro's main event loop has been reworked (Robin Sommer).  This should
  (1) not cause any visible differences in most cases, (2) improve
  performance in some cases, (3) fixed problems running Bro without
  a network input (but still receiving asynchronous input from remote
  event sources).  There are some more changes coming to this soon.

- Passive OS fingerprinting has been added, based on Michal Zalewski's
  "p0f" tool (Holger Dreger).  Currently, it's limited to fingerprinting
  clients based on the initial SYNs they send.  To use it, define
  an event handler:

	OS_version_found(c: connection, host: addr, OS: OS_version)

  OS_version is a record containing a string $genre (e.g., "Solaris"),
  a string $detail (e.g., "2.0.27"), a count $dist (hop-count distance
  from monitor to host), and $match_type, which specifies via an
  enumerated type whether the match was direct from a signature,
  generic to the genre, or "fuzzy".

  The match is done against a passive fingerprinting signature file,
  which is specified by the variable passive_fingerprint_file.
  It defaults to "sigs/p0fsyn", which is found using $BROPATH
  and has an "osf" suffix added.

  You can restrict the matching to only be performed for hosts from
  particular subnets by adding those subnets to the variable
  generate_OS_version_event.  If it's empty (default), then all subnets
  are analyzed.

  Note, the passive fingerprinting should be integrated with the
  version-tracking in software.bro, but this hasn't been done yet.

- Support for IPv6 has been repaired and brought up to date.  Note, however,
  that inter-Bro communication currently only works over IPv4.

- Signature-matching is now off by default in brolite.bro.  If you want
  to use it, define use_signatures = T prior to @load'ing it.

- Notices are now tied to their corresponding connections (Scott Campbell).

- New backdoor detectors for IRC, SMTP, Gaobot (Scott Campbell).

- Signature matches now have a connection associated with them (Scott Campbell).

- Bro scripts that set initial timers (via "schedule" statements in a
  bro_init handler) but don't have any source of network input (trace
  files or live interfaces) now execute in real-time, with network_time
  set to the current time, rather than having their timers expire immediately.

- Default timeouts have been added to tables in trw.bro and http.bro, which
  have been found operationally to potentially grow very large (Scott Campbell).

- The new policy script large-conns.bro can be included in order to
  track the size of TCP connections (each direction is referred to
  as a "flow") using a secondary packet filter (Chema Gonzalez).
  This method is completely separate from Bro's usual size accounting,
  and offers the advantages that it tracks sizes even for connections
  that don't terminate (or for which Bro misses their establishment)
  and for connections with sizes > 4 GB.

  The interface is via the function:

	function estimate_flow_size_and_remove(cid: conn_id, orig: bool)

  If $orig=T, then an estimate of the size of the forward (originator)
  direction is returned.  If $orig=F, then the reverse (responder) direction
  is returned.  In both cases, what's returned is a "flow_size_est" record,
  which includes a flag, $have_est, indicating whether there was any
  estimate formed. If $have_est is T, then the record also includes
  an estimate in bounded by $lower (lower bound) and $upper (upper bound).
  The estimate also includes $num_inconsistent, which, if > 0, means that
  the estimates came from sequence numbers that were inconsistent, and
  thus something is wrong - perhaps packet drops by the secondary filter).
  Finally, calling the function causes the flow's record to be deleted.

- An RSH analyzer has been contributed by Manu (ManuX@rstack.org).
  It generates rsh_request and rsh_reply events, and the following notices:

	  DifferentRSH_Usernames
		Client and server username differ.

	  FailedRSH_Authentication
		Attempt to authenticate via RSH failed.

	  InteractiveRSH
		The RSH session appears to be interactive (multiple
		lines of user commands).

	  SensitiveRSH_Input
	  SensitiveRSH_Output
		RSH client input or server output match input_trouble/
		full_input_trouble or output_trouble/full_output_trouble.

- The new notice action NOTICE_EMAIL indicates that in addition to
  logging an alarm, it should also be sent out as email (Scott Campbell).
  By default, email is only sent if Bro is running on live traffic;
  you can override this via redef'ing the script variable mail_notification.
  Mail is sent using the script specified by the mail_script variable
  (default: "mail_script.sh", which is now included in the distribution,
  but at present is not installed), which must be in $PATH.  The mail
  is sent to the username specified in mail_dest (default: the local
  "bro" user, though you can change this to name@domain).

  Note that specifying email as a separate notice action may change
  in the future, to instead be an attribute that's associated with
  other notice actions.  For example, it may make sense to want
  to specify both NOTICE_ALARM_PER_CONN and NOTICE_EMAIL; currently,
  however, you can't do this.

- A similar notice action NOTICE_PAGE does the same thing as NOTICE_EMAIL
  except it send the mail to mail_page_dest (Scott Campbell).

- You can now use the attribute &rotate_size for file objects to
  specify the maximum file size in bytes (Robin Sommer). If the limit
  is reached, the file is rotated similiarly as is already done with
  &rotate (which, for consistency, has been renamed to &rotate_interval).

  For both &rotate_size and &rotate_interval, when they trigger they
  now generate events (rotate_size and rotate_interval, respectively;
  each takes the file as the sole argument) rather than invoking
  &postprocessor, which has been removed.

  There's also a new variable log_rotate_size to set a global size maximum.

  Related to log rotation are the following new built-in functions:

	rotate_file(f: file) closes the file, moves it to a temporary
	name, and opens a new one. It returns the new "rotate_info"
	record, which gives the temporary name and the open/close times.

	rotate_file_by_name(s: string): similar, but call by the name
	of the file rather than a Bro script value.  This is needed
	because some files are not represented by file objects but need
	to be rotated nevertheless (most importantly, the tcpdump save
	file and the dump files for dump_current_packet()). This function
	rotates the file with the given name.

  Finally, you can load the new policy script rotate-logs.bro to
  get default behavior of rotating all log files every hour.

- The new "@unload <script>" directive specifies that future @load's of
  <script> should be skipped.  This is useful for overriding analyzers
  loaded by scripts that pull in a bunch of analysis.  For example,

	@unload ntp
	@load mt

  would load all of the "mt" analyzers *except* ntp.bro.

- The new built-in function get_file_name(f: file): string returns
  the filename associated with a file (John McNicholas).

- The new built-in function get_contents_file(id: conn_id, direction: count)
  returns the contents file (set using set_contents_file()) for the given
  direction (John McNicholas).

- The new built-ins time_to_double() and double_to_time() convert between
  double values and time values (Robin Sommer).  The new built-in floor()
  returns the floor of a double value; this returned value is also a double.
  Thus, floor(-3.4) returns -4.0.

- Support for sending packets between Bro's (Robin Sommer).

- Bro now has a geneal mechanism internal for traversing policy scripts
  (Umesh Shankar).  Various script analyses can be specified using the
  new -z flag.

  Currently, the one supported form of analysis is "-z notice", which
  prints all of the different types of notices that the script you've
  loaded can generate.  For example, "bro -z notice ftp" will generate:

	  Found NOTICE: BackscatterSeen
	  Found NOTICE: FTP_PrivPort
	  Found NOTICE: FTP_BadPort
	  Found NOTICE: PortScan
	  Found NOTICE: FTP_ExcessiveFilename
	  Found NOTICE: ScanSummary
	  Found NOTICE: AddressDropped
	  Found NOTICE: DroppedPackets
	  Found NOTICE: SensitiveConnection
	  Found NOTICE: FTP_UnexpectedConn
	  Found NOTICE: SSH_Overflow
	  Found NOTICE: FTP_Sensitive
	  Found NOTICE: TerminatingConnection
	  Found NOTICE: PasswordGuessing
	  Found NOTICE: AddressDropIgnored
	  Found NOTICE: AddressScan

- The signature rule language now supports an "active" keyword,
  which can be set to "true" or "false", with the latter turning
  off the rule (Roger Winslow).  If set to false the signature will
  not be loaded into the rule matcher, otherwise it is.

- The signature rule language now supports meta data of the form
  ".MMM<whitespace>XXX", where MMM is arbitrary text which makes up the name
  of the meta data option and where XXX is arbitrary text up to the end
  of the current line (Roger Winslow).  The intent is that some forms of
  meta-data will be regularized/standardized in the future - information
  such as date modifed, category/class, weighting, etc.  For now, it
  provides a way to annotate rules with nominally more structure than just
  using comments (though it is currently treated the same, i.e., everything
  is ignored).

- The following meta data option names are now reserved: .version, .revision,
  .version-date, .revision-date, .date-created, .location

- The new enumerated type "transport_proto" is used to specify different
  types of transport protocols: "tcp", "udp", "icmp", and "unknown_transport".
  Associated with it are new built-in functions: is_udp_prot(), is_icmp_port(),
  get_conn_transport_proto, and get_port_transport_proto.  The latter two
  map a given connection and a given "port" value to their corresponding
  transport_proto value.

- A bunch of tuning (regular expressions for sensitive login sessions,
  scan detection thresholds, forbidden/hot usernames and filenames,
  sensitive URIs, "weird" actions) have been incorporated from
  operational configurations.

- Serious bugs in managing large numbers of files fixed.

- A serious bug with negative DNS TTL settings (and, more generally,
  with negative timer values) fixed.

- The traditional connection logging format is no longer supported.

- The SMTP analyzer's state machine processing has been modified to
  correctly deal with clients that (incorrectly) pipeline their commands
  (Ruoming Pang).

- A bug fixed in detecting SMTP relays for connections w/o message bodies
  (Ruoming Pang).

- A bunch of bugs in recording connection summaries for UDP flows
  have been fixed.

- A new script module, passwords.bro, generates PasswordExposed notices
  for activity (currently just rlogin/telnet logins) that expose passwords.

- A new script module, file-flush.bro, can be loaded to cause all log
  files to be flushed every file_flush_interval (default: 10) seconds.
  This is handy if you like to watch the files in real time.

- Zone transfers now generate a ZoneTransfer notice, unless the host
  making the request is in DNS::zone_transfers_okay.

- Bro's DNS cache (generated using -P and accessed using -F) is
  now kept in the .state/ subdirectory rather than in the user's
  home directory (Roger Winslow).

- Some changes to remote propagation of events/values and detection of
  state inconsistencies (Robin Sommer).

- A fix for avoiding delays on low-volume links for some systems for
  which it can take a long time to fill up the pcap buffer, and pcap doesn't
  return partial buffers (Robin Sommer).

- A bug in table expiration timers has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- A bug in comparing subnets has been fixed.

- A bug in using a non-constant value for a &write_expire attribute
  has been fixed.

- A bug in using CONTENTS_BOTH for writing reassembled streams to
  files has been fixed (John McNicholas).

- A subtle but potentially damaging bug in fragment reassembly has
  been fixed.

- A bug with using local variables of vector types has been fixed.

- A bug with comparing strings has been fixed.

- Bro no longer generates the RST_with_data "weird", as with modern
  stacks it's no longer any sort of strange occurrence.

- Related to this, the signature rule matcher no longer matches
  against the payload of RST packets.  (Note, this is an imcompatibility
  with Snort.)

- Portmapper mappings are now written in the connection log in
  alphabetical order.

- The event engine variable frag_timeout now defaults to 5 minutes if you
  load frag.bro, and is accessed via redef rather than by defining the
  global directly.

- The interval that signatures.bro waits for until generating a signature
  summary can now be set using the new script variable sig_summary_interval,
  and a bug in generating the summaries has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- The new script peer-status.bro generates periodic "update" events regarding
  a remote peer's status (Robin Sommer).  These take the form:

	type peer_status: record {
		res: bro_resources;
		stats: net_stats;
		current_time: time;
		cpu: double;		# average CPU load since last update
		default_filter: string;	# default capture filter
	};

- The bro_resources record returned by resource_usage() now includes
  three additional fields, $version (the version of Bro), $debug
  (T if Bro was compiled with debugging information), and $start_time
  (the time Bro began executing - clock time, not network time).

- The new built-in function same_object(o1: any, o2: any): bool
  returns true if its arguments refer to the same object, false
  otherwise.  This can be useful for comparing tables, for example
  in calls to table element expiration functions.

- The new built-in function bro_is_terminating(): bool returns true if
  Bro is done reading from its network input source(s) and is now
  in its final termination cleanup (Robin Sommer).

- A new built-in strftime() formats a timestamp, returning a string
  (Robin Sommer).

- A new built-in file_size() returns the size of the file with a
  given name (Robin Sommer - note: *not* a Bro file value).

- A potential deadlock with inter-Bro communication has been fixed
  (Robin Sommer).

- Bro now always forks a copy of itself when executing, as this
  can save considerable memory when using inter-Bro communication
  (Robin Sommer).

- The Bro interconnection protocol now includes explicit handshaking
  during session establishment to mark that a peer is ready (Robin Sommer).
  Implementing this includes a change in the wire protocol that is
  incompatible with the protocol used in the past.

- The TCP inactivity timer is now started whenever a connection
  transitions from a pre-establishment state (including "inactive")
  to some sort of established state (Robin Sommer).  Prior to this
  fix, connections for which a proper SYN handshake was not seen would
  not be timed out as inactive.

- The --disable-openssl configure option has been removed; now
  the only option is --with-openssl, and --with-openssl=no disables
  use of OpenSSL (Gregor Maier).

- A bug in invoking &expire_func functions has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- A bug in logfile rotation has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- A bug in recognizing negative floating point values has been fixed.

- worm.bro now suppresses the default signature action for worms
  it knows about, since it generates events for them (Robin Sommer).
  The list of worms detected via signatures now includes Bagle-BC.

- Signatures for known worms are now skipped when doing signature
  summaries and scan detection, if worm.bro is loaded (Robin Sommer).

- request_remote_events and request_remote_sync now implicitly
  do set_accept_state, too.

- Better error handling for SSL connections (Robin Sommer).

- Bug fixed which caused diagnostic messages to be lost when using
  inter-Bro communication (Robin Sommer).

- gcc 3.4 portability fixes (Brian Lindauer).

- Solaris portability fixes (Robin Sommer).

- The Bro distribution now includes and uses its own version of libpcap
  for portability reasons (Jason Lee).

- Some minor bug fixes to handling of tcpdump save files (Robin Sommer).

- Detection added for a (now quite old) SSHv1 overflow attack.

- A bug in skipping processing of connections for large chunks of
  data has been fixed (Chema Gonzalez).

- Some memory leaks fixed (Robin Sommer).

- fmt()'s "%d" format now accepts values of enum types.


0.9a7 Mon Nov  1 13:21:05 PST 2004

- New terminology:

	o We've found that the term "log" has been too overloaded,
	  sometimes meaning "something to record for audit purposes" and
	  other times meaning "something worthy of getting the operator's
	  attention right now, for example via syslog".

	  We are now using "log" to only refer to the first of these,
	  and refer to the second as "alarm".

	o We've found that "alert" (and the ALERT() function, etc) is
	  likewise confusing.  Some expect it to mean something alarm-worthy
	  (to use the new name from the previous item), while others
	  expect it to mean the output from a sensor, which might not
	  be worth getting the operator's attention.

	  We are now using "notice" to refer to what had previously
	  been called "alert".  So, for example, rather than call ALERT()
	  you call NOTICE() to enter something into the I've-seen-something-
	  maybe-it's-worth-an-alarm framework.  The first field associated
	  with such a call was $alert, which is now $note.  These notifications
	  are logged to notice.$BRO_LOG_SUFFIX rather than "alert."...

  These changes show up in many places in the policy scripts.  Some
  globals log_XXX are now alarm_XXX or notice_XXX.  However, uses of
  "log" that refer to "something to record for audit purposes" remain
  using that name.

- Bro now uses the "automake" suite of tools for its configuration
  (Jason Lee).  This includes major reworking of its Makefile's
  and configuration/installation scripts.

- Bro now flags event handlers that are never invoked (Umesh Shankar).
  This catches typos like:

	event bro_initt() { ... }

- The scripts directory now includes scripts for generating nightly
  reports (Roger Winslow).  Note that these are not presently a supported
  part of the public Bro distribution, but will become so in the
  not-too-distant future.

- policy/brolite.bro contains a first version of the "Bro Lite" configuration
  (Scott Campbell, Roger Winslow, et al).  This also is not presently
  supported for the public Bro distribution, but will become so.

- Major overhaul of the internal serialization framework (Robin Sommer).
  Some more changes are forthcoming, though not on this scale.

- Changed packet capture/drop statistics to (1) explicitly track received
  packets, (2) work better under Linux, (3) report link counts when available
  (Robin Sommer).  The net_stats record field "interface_drops" has been
  renamed "pkts_link".  It reports the number of packets captured by the
  NIC (if available), rather than the number dropped by the NIC (which never
  actually worked, anyway).

- The DNS analysis has been extended to deal with TSIG and to better deal
  with EDNS0 records, and its overall structure reworked somewhat
  (Scott Campbell & Roger Winslow).  The scripts in dns.bro are now
  inside "module DNS" scope.

- Improved logging of ICMP flows (Scott Campbell).  This includes the
  addition of a "len" field in icmp_conn.  Some significant additional
  changes/improvements to ICMP processing will be coming very soon.

- The Bro README and "quick start" documentation has been updated
  (Brian Tierney and Jim Rothfuss).

- Some significant state-holding problems in the presence of packet filtering
  or packet drops have been fixed.

- You can now instruct the signature engine to constrain the number of
  regular expressions it groups together into a single matcher using the
  new script variable "sig_max_group_size" (Robin Sommer).  This can result
  in significant memory savings for large sets of signatures.  It can
  increase the CPU processing required; however, in our testing so far
  this does not appear to be the case.

- The signature engine now provides better location information in its
  error messages (Robin Sommer).

- statistics.bro has been renamed profiling.bro.  Along with this change,
  the following script variables have been renamed:

	do_statistics => do_profiling
	statistics_file => profiling_file
	statistics_interval => profiling_interval

- A new script, stats.bro, can be included to generate light-weight
  running statistics on memory and CPU use.

- A new script, print-sig-states.bro, can be included to generate
  periodic dumps of signature-matching statistics (Robin Sommer).

- The connect_clear()/connect_ssl() built-ins have been replaced
  by a single connect() function (Robin Sommer).

- Remote Bro's (more generally, remote event sources) are now represented
  in policy scripts using the new "event_peer" type rather than as an
  addr/port pair, and get_event_source() has been renamed get_event_peer()
  (Robin Sommer).  The new function get_local_event_peer() returns an
  event_peer corresponding to the local Bro.

- The new script remote-print.bro can be used to print all events
  received from remote sources (Robin Sommer).

- When you call send_state(), an event finished_send_state() is now
  generated when all of the state has been sent (Robin Sommer).

- If you define a handler for the new print_hook() event, then it
  will be invoked every time a "print" statement executes (Robin Sommer).

- The -g flag no longer takes a directory as an argument, but always
  uses the .state directory (Robin Sommer).

- The new -I flag prints the value of a given identifier and exits
  (Robin Sommer).  This flag may go away in the future.  For now,
  its role is that it prints timestamps of things like table elements,
  which are no longer printed by a regular "print" statement.

- If a connection proceeds as SYN ->, <- RST, RST ->, this is now
  reported as a regular rejected ("REJ") connection, rather than
  one reset by the originator ("RSTO").

- The TCP analyzer now attempts to detect connections for which
  one side's packets are being filtered out.  It does this using
  two C++ variables (not presently accessible at the script level),

	const int max_initial_window = 4096;
	const int max_above_hole_without_any_acks = 4096;

  If more than max_initial_window data has been sent by one side and no
  ACKs have been seen by the other side, then it's assumed that no ACKs
  will ever show up, and the buffer for the data should be reclaimed
  immediately after it's reassembled.  max_above_hole_without_any_acks
  plays a similar role, but for the case when measurement drops have
  lead to Bro holding data for a sender for which it will never see
  an ACK (which would be an "ACK above hole"), so it should give up
  on buffering it.

- A portability bug in Bro's parser code has been fixed (Jason Lee).

- STARTTLS for SMTP now causes the SMTP session to be ignored, rather
  than generating a slew of error messages because the session becomes
  unparseable.

- Bro's "watchdog" handler is now less prone to crashing due to
  using non-reentrant library calls (Jason Lee).

- Better error message when reading an input file encounters an error.

- adtrace now prints its usage when invoked without the required
  arguments (Jason Lee).

- A bug in using recursive script functions has been fixed.

- A bunch of whitespace/code layout tweaks.


0.9a4 Wed Sep  8 17:33:54 PDT 2004

- The directory structure of the Bro distribution has changed (Jason Lee).
  The source code is now in a subdirectory, src/, and the scripts
  snort2bro (and snort2bro.cfg) and make-ftp-safe-vocabulary.awk have
  been moved into scripts/.

- "make install" has been revamped (Jason Lee).

- The format of the alert log file has changed.  Fields in it are
  colon-separated.  THIS WILL LIKELY CHANGE SOON.

- The policy for formatting signature matches has been revamped,
  including colon-separated fields in the signature log file
  (Roger Winslow).  THIS WILL LIKELY CHANGE SOON.

- The BRO_ID environment variable has been renamed BRO_LOG_SUFFIX.

- A new flag, -e, lets you specify Bro code to execute via the command
  line (Christian Kreibich).  So, for example,

	bro -r mytrace.tcpdump -e 'redef traditional_conn_format = T' tcp

  will run tcp.bro on the trace "mytrace.tcpdump", but with
  traditional_conn_format redefined to be true.  Note that statements
  have an implicit ';' added to them for convenience.

- A new signature alert, "MultipleSigResponders", is generated if a
  host triggers the same signature on multiple responders.

- Bro now supports "packet profiling", which provides fairly fine-grained
  statistics on number of packets processed, volume, elapsed real/user/system
  time, and change in memory consumption (Holger Dreger).  Three variables
  control the output.  The double pkt_profile_freq controls the frequency
  of output.  The units in which it's interpreted depends on the setting
  of the pkt_profile_mode variable (which is of type pkt_profile_modes,
  an enum).  A value of PKT_PROFILE_MODE_SECS means that statistics
  are generated every pkt_profile_freq seconds; PKT_PROFILE_MODE_PKTS
  means every pkt_profile_freq packets; and PKT_PROFILE_MODE_BYTES, every
  pkt_profile_freq bytes.  The default (PKT_PROFILE_MODE_NONE) means
  to not generate packet profiling.

  Packet profiling is written to the new log file, pkt_profile_file.
  If you "@load pkt-profile", you can turn on packet profiling using
  some handy defaults.

- statistics.bro now reports on how many TCP connections are in
  <originator-state, responder-state> for the different TCP endpoint
  states (SYN sent, SYN ack'd, connection established, etc.).
  Contributed by Holger Dreger.

- tcp_content_delivery_ports_{orig,resp} are now table's of bool rather
  than set's (Ruoming Pang).  The semantics are that if you have a
  tcp_contents event handler, then if the orig/resp port is in the given
  table *and the yield value is T*, then the event will be invoked.  This
  allows you to now explicitly skip over some ports.

- The processing of default values in tables has been changed internally
  (Ruoming Pang).  It's possible this has introduced some subtle bugs
  (as some of these came up during testing).

- A serious bug in Base64 processing has been fixed (Ruoming Pang).

- The NetBIOS and SMB analyzers have been updated in minor ways
  (Ruoming Pang).

- statistics.bro now reports a "lag" figure indicating the elasped
  time between the last expired timer's target expiration time and
  the current packet timestamp (Robin Sommer).  Lag can grow if Bro
  is getting behind in timer expiration due to the setting of
  max_timer_expires.

- Bro's default filter is now "tcp or udp or icmp" rather than
  "tcp or udp".

- alert_info records now have an optional port associated with them
  (for example, to be used to describe scan activity).

- A bug has been fixed in which deleting a table element with an
  associated timer could crash Bro (Robin Sommer).

- A bug that would cause a crash for malformed EPASV directives
  has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- A bug with inactivity timeouts not being generated for partial
  connections has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- A bug in synflood.bro has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- Some tuning adjustments to incremental expiration of table entries
  (Robin Sommer).

- Improved portability to Darwin (Christian Kreibich).

- alert_info records now have additional optional fields, "iconn"
  (associated ICMP connection), "dst" (destination address), and
  "p" (associated port).  The source_is_responder fields has been
  removed.

- The default packet filter now includes "icmp".

- Some memory allocation/free mismatches & minor leaks (Robin Sommer).

- Minor tweaks to ssl.bro (Robin Sommer).

- Bro now supports "null" link layers (Christian Kreibich).

- aux/adtrace contains a program that spits out MAC/IP information
  from traces (Holger Dreger).

- A bug in handling malformed RPCs has been fixed (Scott Campbell).

- The formatting of "weird" messages that have additional parameters
  has been changed to be more regularized with other "weird" messages.

- The new "weird" type "base64_illegal_encoding" takes the place of
  some previously unstructured Base64 "weird" errors.

- A tweak to ftp.bro will give it slightly more consistent results
  for some forms of unusual traffic.


0.9a3 Wed Jul  7 22:06:26 PDT 2004

- Improved ICMP processing, including scan detection (Scott Campbell).

- ICMP "connections" are now considered unidirectional.

- Fixed broken VLAN support (integration of original patch was incomplete).

- Fixed a bug in erroneously generating additional "ContentGap"
  alerts after an initial one.

- Connection durations are now always reported as floating-point decimal,
  never in exponential notation.

- Removed unused time parameter from a bunch of internal calls.

- Fixed some compilation warnings.

- "make clean" now removes generated policy/*.bif.bro files (Christian
  Kreibich).


0.9a2 Fri Jun 11 00:07:04 PDT 2004

- NetBIOS analysis has been extended with a CIFS/SMB analyzer (Ruoming Pang).
  While this is incomplete, it has many important elements.  The corresponding
  events:

	smb_message(c: connection, is_orig: bool, cmd: string, msg: string)
	smb_com_tree_connect_andx(c: connection, path: string, service: string)
	smb_com_nt_create_andx(c: connection, name: string)
	smb_com_transaction(c: connection, is_orig: bool, subcmd: count,
				name: string, data: string)
	smb_com_transaction2(c: connection, is_orig: bool, subcmd: count,
				name: string, data: string)
	smb_com_read_andx(c: connection, is_orig: bool, data: string)
	smb_com_write_andx(c: connection, is_orig: bool, data: string)

  This analyzer is still experimental.

- Greater support for vectors (Umesh Shankar), much of it taken from
  the 'S' language.

  You can use a boolean vector as an index into another vector (providing
  both are the same length) and each 'T' value in the index extracts the
  corresponding element from the indexed vector.  For example, "x[x > 3]"
  returns a vector whose elements are those elements of x that are greater
  than, while if y is a vector of the same length as x then "y[x > 3]"
  extracts those elements of y that have the same position as the elements
  in x that are greater than 3.

  You can also use an arithmetic vector to index another vector.  Each
  element present in the index is extracted.  So, for example:

	global a: vector of count;
	global b: vector of string;

	a[1] = 3;
	a[2] = 3;
	a[3] = 1;

	b[1] = "foo";
	b[2] = "bar";
	b[3] = "bletch";

	print b[a];

  prints:

	[bletch, bletch, foo]

- The new built-ins any_set() and all_set() return true if for a given
  boolean vector any element is true or all of the elements is true
  (Umesh Shankar).  So, for example, "any_set(x < 0)" returns T if
  an element of x is less than zero.

- The new built-in sort() takes a vector as an argument and sorts it
  *in place* (Umesh Shankar).  (The in-place semantics may change in the
  future.)  An optional second argument can be used to specify a
  function to call for comparing elements, and is required for non-arithmetic
  vectors.  For example, the following could be used to sort a vector
  of strings based solely on the length of the strings:

	function string_compare(a : string, b: string): int
		{
		local la = byte_len(a);
		local lb = byte_len(b);

		return (la < lb) ? -1 : ((lb > la) ? 1 : 0);
		}

- The new function order() has the same calling sequence as sort(),
  but instead of returning (and altering in place) the sorted vector,
  it returns a "vector of count" giving the *indices* that if used
  to index the vector will return it sorted.  So, for example,
  given two vectors x and y of the same length (but not necessarily
  of the same type),

	local x_sort_indices = order(x);
	x = x[x_sort_indices];
	y = y[x_sort_indices];

  will assign x to a sorted version of itself and also rearrange y such
  that elements of y that were paired with elements of x originally
  remain paired after the sorting.

- The ICMP analyzer now has a general notion of "context", i.e., the packet
  associated with ICMP status messages such as Unreachable or Time Exceeded
  (Ruoming Pang).  This changes the parameters to the icmp_unreachable
  event.  A new event, icmp_time_exceed, is now also available.

- The tcp_segment even has been replaced by a pair of new events (Ruoming Pang):

	tcp_packet(c: connection, is_orig: bool, flags: string, seq: count,
			ack: count, len: count, payload: string)

  is invoked for each TCP packet.  "flags" is a string containing "SFAPU"
  for the SYN/FIN/etc TCP flags.

	  tcp_contents(c: connection, is_orig: bool, seq: count,
			contents: string)

  is invoked for each chunk of the byte-stream that has been reassembled
  in sequence, providing it satisfies tcp_content_delivery_ports_{orig,resp},
  per the next item.

- You can specify the set of ports for which contents should be reassembled
  for the originator (responder, respectively) stream using the new sets
  tcp_content_delivery_ports_{orig,resp} (Ruoming Pang).  This can be
  useful for user-level stream analysis for protocols not known to Bro's
  event engine.  These controls may change to a "table of bool" in the future,
  in order to support an &default attribute.

- New built-in functions (Ruoming Pang):

	function interval_to_double(i: interval): double
		Converts a value of type "interval" to "double".

	function write_file(f: file, data: string): bool
		Writes the given string to the given file, returning
		F on error.

	function is_ascii(str: string): bool
		Returns T if the given string consists entirely of
		ASCII characters (i.e., in the range 0..127).

	function sqrt(x: double): double
		Returns the square-root of x, or -1 and a run-time error
		if x is < 0.

	function uuid_to_string(uuid: string): string
		Takes a UUID and returns its string representation, where
		UUID = Universal Unique Identifier as defined per
		http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9629399/apdxa.htm#tagcjh_20

	function string_to_ascii_hex(s: string): string
		Returns the ASCII hex representation of the given string.
		For example, string_to_ascii_hex("foo") returns "666f6f".

	function match_pattern(s: string, p:pattern): pattern_match_result
		Matches the given pattern against the given string, returning
		a record with three fields:

			matched: bool;	# T if a match was found, F otherwise
			str: string;	# portion of string that first matched
			off: count;	# 1-based offset where match starts

		For example,
			match_pattern("foobar", /o*[a-k]/)
		returns
			[matched=T, str=f, off=1]
		because the *first* match is for zero o's followed by an [a-k],
		while
			match_pattern("foobar", /o+[a-k]/)
		returns
			[matched=T, str=oob, off=2]

- Functions that terminate without returning a value when they were declared
  to do so now generate a run-time warning (Christian Kreibich).  Functions
  in the standard set of policy scripts that did this have been fixed.

- The new event non_dns_request(c: connection, msg: string) is generate
  to make the contents of malformed DNS requests available for analysis,
  with the assumption that these are actually some other protocol entirely
  (Ruoming Pang).

- If you redef truncate_http_URI to have a value >= 0, then any HTTP
  URIs generated by the event engine will be truncated to this length
  (Ruoming Pang).  This can be convenient when analyzing traffic that
  generates huge URIs (as do some automated attacks).

- "SEARCH" is now recognized as a standard HTTP method (Ruoming Pang).

- The new event connection_EOF(c: connection, is_orig: bool) is generated
  when one side of a connection closes (Ruoming Pang).

- synflood.bro and the corresponding event engine internals now works
  in terms of probabilities (0.0-1.0) instead of percentages (0-100)
  (Robin Sommer).  The script has had several tweaks, including using
  new_connection() rather than connection_attempt(), which gives it
  quicker response and broader coverage (it'll detect non-TCP flooding,
  too, so "synflood" is now a bit of a misnomer), at the cost of perhaps
  more CPU load.

- A signature for Witty has been added to policy/sigs/worm.sig (Ruoming Pang).

- Makefile now has a "test" target.  Currently this only works for internal
  development (we haven't put together a public test suite yet; that will
  take some time due to the need to make sure no sensitive information leaks).

- The built-in function generator now knows about "double" as a built-in type
  (Ruoming Pang).

- Some generated files have been removed from the Bro distribution since
  they're redundant (Ruoming Pang).

- A bug has been fixed in which contents files might not be correctly
  written upon termination of Bro (Ruoming Pang).

- A bug has been fixed in which UDP connections didn't generate
  new_connection events (Ruoming Pang).

- Support for the Linux "cooked capture" link layer (Ruoming Pang).

- BPF support has been factored into a separate class, BPF_Program, which
  makes for easier portability (Christian Kreibich).

- A serious low-level Dictionary bug has been fixed (Christian Kreibich).

- A bug that could cause Bro to crash if it receives an event from another
  Bro that it isn't able to process has been fixed (Christian Kreibich).

- A bug in set file descriptors non-blocking has been fixed
  (Christian Kreibich).

- A bug that could cause some error messages to generate crashes has
  been fixed.

- The global skip_event_tcp_option has been removed.


0.9a1 Mon Jun  7 01:33:00 PDT 2004

- 0.8a85 is the new STABLE release, to be updated only for bug (and
  portability) fixes.  0.9a1 is the new CURRENT release, which will have
  both bug fixes and new functionality.

- Support for FTP EPRT, EPSV (Holger Dreger).

- Change to timer management to recover memory more quickly (Robin Sommer).

- Tweaks to eliminate a number of compiler warnings (Robin Sommer).

- Statistics now report number of connections terminated due
  to inactivity (Robin Sommer).

- New Makefile target, pub-tar-no-doc builds a public tarball but
  without the (large) doc/ subdirectory.

- Bug fix for identd requests with illegal port numbers.

- The example of a scanning source to skip in scan.bro has been changed
  from an AltaVista robot (now obsolete) to a Google robot.

- Some previously fatal internal errors have now been turned into
  "internal warnings", which Bro is able to continue operating
  in their presence.


0.8a84 Wed May 26 23:33:39 PDT 2004

- autoconf tweaks for portability to Darwin (Christian Kreibich).

- Fixed subtle bug in chunked-IO reads (Christian Kreibich).

- Fixed bug for the "discarder" framework in which specifying an
  IP discarder would cause other TCP/UDP/ICMP discarders not being
  invoked (Christian Kreibich).

- Fatal bug in signature matching fixed (Robin Sommer).

- Missing member variable initialization fixed (Robin Sommer).  (Needed for
  compilation with new versions of gcc.)

- Makefile bug for "make install" fixed.

- Fixed bug that could lead to Bro crashing if an SMTP session
  had data sent after a RST.

- Removed some out-of-date SMTP analysis warning messages.


0.8a82 Tue Apr 27 11:53:24 PDT 2004

- Fixed inactivity timer loop when a packet arrives exactly when
  the timer is set to expire.


0.8a81 Mon Apr 26 22:46:37 PDT 2004

- A bunch of memory leaks fixed (Chema Gonzalez).

- A new HTTP analyzer variable, content_truncation_limit, controls
  how much of an HTTP request/reply contents element (i.e., what's
  passed to http_entity_data - this is *not* the entire content, but
  the next chunk's worth) is logged in the log file.  It defaults
  to 40 bytes.  Setting it to 0 means "log all of it".

- Fix to avoid crashing for malformed RPC requests.

- Improved OpenSSL auto-configuration (Robin Sommer).

- Fix for compiling without OpenSSL.

- A new built-in, double_to_count(), converts a value of type "double"
  to the corresponding "count" (Chema Gonzalez).  We should probably
  add floor(), ceil(), etc.

- Parameterization of trw.bro tweaked (Jaeyeon Jung).


0.8a79 Wed Mar 24 22:02:53 PST 2004

- Bro now has an SSL analyzer, written by Michael Kuhn and Benedikt Ostermaier,
  with further development by Scott Campbell.  It generates the following
  events:

	event process_X509_extensions(c: connection, ex: X509_extension)
	event ssl_X509_error(c: connection, err: int, err_string: string)
	event ssl_certificate(c: connection, cert: X509, is_server: bool)
	event ssl_certificate_seen(c: connection, is_server: bool)
	event ssl_conn_alert(c: connection, version: count, level: count,
				description: count)
	event ssl_conn_attempt(c: connection, version: int)
	event ssl_conn_established(c: connection, version: int,
				cipher_suite: count)
	event ssl_conn_reused(c: connection, session_id: sessionID)
	event ssl_conn_server_reply(c: connection, version: int)
	event ssl_conn_weak(name: string, c: connection)
	event ssl_session_insertion(c: connection, id: sessionID)

  Note, it still has a lot of rough edges; particularly, handling
  non-conformant input.  It also generates unnecessary ContentGap alerts
  due to the way it runs multiple analyzers (SSLv2 and SSLv3) on a single
  connection.  This will be fixed in the fairly near-term future.

- The manual has been updated with chapters on signatures (Robin Sommer)
  and using the interactive debugger (Umesh Shankar), along with a partial
  description of the new SSL analyzer (Michael Kuhn and Benedikt Ostermaier)
  and a number of updates to the documentation of built-in functions (Umesh
  Shankar), though this latter is still not complete since Umesh actually
  contributed this quite a while ago.

- Ruoming Pang has contributed a crude analyzer for DCE/RPC (used for Windows).
  It generates simple dce_rpc_request and dce_rpc_reply events.  It should
  not be considered stable.

- The traditional connection logging format (traditional_conn_format)
  is no longer the default.  The 0.8a70 release notes stated that this
  was the case but this time it really is :-).

- An experimental "vector" type has been added (Umesh Shankar).  A vector
  is an aggregate type.  For example:

	local suspect_hosts: vector of addr;

  You can randomly access elements starting with the first as 1, e.g.,

	suspect_hosts[1] = 10.0.0.8;

  and can also add elements at later postions even if there are gaps:

	suspect_hosts[31337] = 10.0.0.9;

  *The semantics and capabilities of vectors will be changing considerably.*

- Umesh Shankar has developed a framework for generating IDMEF messages.
  Currently it needs a modified version of libidmef, which is not included
  in this distribution.  Contact me or Umesh if you want a copy.

- A new attribute &synchronized causes the given global variable to
  be *synchronized* across concurrent instances of Bro (which are
  intercommunicating via remote.bro).  Any change made by one of them
  to the variable will be reflected (soon after) in the copy at
  the others.  A new event remote_state_inconsistency is generated
  if two instances both change the value before they're synchronized.
  (Contributed by Robin Sommer.)

- trw.bro implements a new scan detection algorithm, Threshold Random Walk
  (Jaeyeon Jung).  It's described in an upcoming IEEE S&P symposium paper.
  The analyzer generates two events:

	TRWAddressScan, # source flagged as scanner by TRW algorithm
	TRWScanSummary, # summary of scanning activities reported by TRW

  TRW is generally much more sensitive than Bro's regular detection algorithm.

- vlan.bro provides support for VLAN encapsulation.  More generally, Bro
  now has support for any sort of constant-offset encapsulation (Vinod
  Yegneswaran).  You specify the header size by redef'ing encap_hdr_size.
  You can also redef tunnel_port to be a UDP port which Bro treats as being
  the encapsulation (in the packet stream - not addressed to it) rather
  than all traffic.

- If you turn on statistics (i.e., via @load statistics) and also redef
  segment_profiling to T, then Bro will generate to the statistics file
  a trace of its "segment" processing.  A segment is a unit of internal
  execution.  Profiles look like:

	1058517499.615430 segment-processing-packet dt=0.000013 dmem=0
	1058517499.615430 segment-draining-events dt=0.000012 dmem=0
	1058517499.615671 segment-expiring-timers dt=0.000010 dmem=0
	1058517499.615671 segment-processing-packet dt=0.000010 dmem=0
	1058517499.615671 segment-draining-events dt=0.000012 dmem=0
	1058517499.615671 segment-policy/conn.bro:282 dt=0.000011 dmem=0
	1058517499.615671 segment-policy/conn.bro:253 dt=0.000012 dmem=0

  The first line states that at the given (packet) timestamp, the event
  engine processed a packet, taking 13 usec of CPU time to do so, and
  not consuming any memory (from the kernel's perspective; this is *not*
  fine-grained memory consumption).  The next lines indicate 12 usec were
  spent draining events and 10 usec expiring timers.  The last two lines
  indicate that the functions at lines 282 and 253 in conn.bro were
  executed, requiring 11 usec and 12 usec, respectively.

  Note #1: timings are just what rusage() reports, so not necessarily
  very accurate for small times.

  Note #2: there's a bug in tracking function line numbers that hasn't
  been ferreted out yet, so they're only roughly correct.

- The inactivity_timeout global has been split into tcp_inactivity_timeout/
  udp_inactivity_timeout/icmp_inactivity_timeout (Robin Sommer).  Using
  this, the default inactivity timeouts for UDP and ICMP have been changed
  from "no timeout" to 10 seconds.  This is needed because otherwise
  analyzing a stream of UDP or ICMP traffic generally gobbles up memory
  quickly and never recovers it; and there's seems little point in trying
  to consolidate long-lived-but-often-inactive UDP/ICMP streams.

- The new policy script cpu-adapt.bro is an extension to load-levels.bro
  (see CHANGES for 0.8a37 below) to adapt the packet filter based on the
  current CPU load. If the load is below cpu_lower_limit (default 40%),
  the load-level is decreased.  If it's above cpu_upper_limit (default
  90%), it's increased.  (Robin Sommer)

- The new policy script hand-over.bro can be used for a new running
  instance of Bro to smoothly take over operation from an old instance,
  i.e., it implements hand-over of state between two Bro instances when
  checkpointing (Robin Sommer). First, all persistent data (i.e. variables
  declared &persistent and connections for which make_connection_persistent()
  has been called) is transferred from the old instance to the new instance.
  Then the old instance terminates itself and the new one starts processing.

  The host from which we want to take over the state has to be added to
  remote_peers_clear (or remote_peers_ssl), setting hand_over to T. The
  host which is allowed to perform a hand-over with us has to be added
  with a port of 0/tcp and hand_over=T. An example for a handover between
  two instances on the same machine:

  @load hand-over
  redef remote_peers_clear += {
        [127.0.0.1, 47756/tcp] = [$hand_over = T],
        [127.0.0.1, 0/tcp] = [$hand_over = T]
        };

  (This interface may be subject to change in the future.)

- New script functions (Robin Sommer):

      function terminate()
          Terminates Bro via SIGTERM.

      function dump_config()
          Dumps Bro's full configuration into state_dir (one file per
          variable/type/function, etc.)

      function send_state(ip: addr, p: port)
          Send all of persistent state to the remote host.

      function set_accept_state(ip: addr, p: port, accept: bool)
          If accept is true, state sent by the given host will be
          accepted (default: false)

      function make_connection_persistent(c: connection)
          Declare the given connection state to be persistent (i.e.
          to be saved upon termination and exchanged by send_state).
          checkpoint.bro uses this to declare some services to be
          persistent by default.

      function is_local_interface(ip: addr): bool
          Returns true if the given address is assigned to a local interface.

- Printing of sets and tables now includes timestamps indicating when the
  element was added (Robin Sommer):

         ID did_ssh_version = {
            [129.187.20.9, F] = 1 @11/01-15:55,
            [212.144.77.26, T] = 2 @11/01-15:55,
            [141.84.116.26, T] = 10 @11/01-15:55,
            [217.232.245.249, T] = 1 @11/01-15:55,
            [217.235.217.149, T] = 1 @11/01-15:55,
            [129.187.39.13, F] = 2 @11/01-15:55,
            [129.187.208.139, F] = 1 @11/01-15:55,
            }

  The format may change in the future, and will probably be made an option.

- Similarly, you can print functions to get both a timestamp of the last
  time the given block was executed and a count of how often (Robin Sommer):

	  ID record_connection = record_connection
	  (@11/01-16:03 #6549)
	  {
	  id = c$id;
	  local_init = is_local_addr(id$orig_h);
	  local_addr = local_init ? id$orig_h : id$resp_h;
		    remote_addr = local_init ? id$resp_h : id$orig_h;
	  flags = local_init ? "L" : "";
	  if (remote_addr in neighbor_nets)
		  (@<never> #0)
		  flags = cat(flags, "U");

	  if ("" == flags)
		  (@11/01-16:03 #2110)
		  flags = "X";

	  is_tcp = is_tcp_port(id$orig_p);
	  ;
	  if (is_tcp)
		  (@11/01-16:03 #6549)
		  {
		  if (c$orig$state in conn_closed || c$resp$state in conn_closed
)
			  (@11/01-16:03 #4739)
			  duration = fmt("%.6g", c$duration);
		  else
			  (@11/01-16:03 #1810)
			  duration = "?";
	  [...]

- You can now specify numbers using hex constants, e.g., 0xabcd = 43981
  (Michael Kuhn and Benedikt Ostermaier).

- A new function, join_string_array(sep: string, a: string_array) concatenates
  strings in 'a' and inserts 'sep' between every two adjacent elements
  (Ruoming Pang).  E.g., join_string_array("", {"a", "b", "c"}) returns
  "a b c", and join_string_array("", a) is the same as cat_string_array(a).

- checkpoint.bro now makes some services persistent by default
  (Robin Sommer).

- The new_packet event now includes both the associated connection
  and a pkt_hdr describing the packet (Robin Sommer).

- The functions functions connect_ssl() and connect_clear() have been replaced
  by a single connect() function taking an additional parameter to
  differentiate the types (Robin Sommer).

- The new function stop_listening() unbinds the listen port (Robin Sommer).

- A new flag packet_filter_default says whether the Bro-level packet-filter
  will by default accept all or reject everything (Robin Sommer).

- Function calls can now be sent to remote Bro's, though there isn't yet
  an interface for accessing this from the script level (Robin Sommer).

- Bro now has an generalized internal framework for serializing objects
  and monitoring access to state (Robin Sommer).

- Better memory allocation accounting (Robin Sommer).

- A minor tweak to the output generated by statistics.bro.

- Improved localization of source code for functions in messages (but
  there are still some bug).

- Autoconf looks for -ltermcap (Robin Sommer).

- Fixes for bugs in the management of table expiration values (Chema Gonzalez).

- A bug in printing "void" values has been fixed (Chema Gonzalez).

- -t bug fixed (Chema Gonzalez).

- A bug has been fixed in which sometimes "expression value ignored"
  was erroneously generated.

- A bug with packet_contents and UDP packets with checksum errors
  has been fixed (Ruoming Pang).

- A memory leak in packet timestamp sorting via packet_sort_window
  has been fixed (Ruoming Pang).

- A bug has been fixed in expanding NULs when printing strings (Ruoming Pang).

- Bug fixes for extracting connection contents via contents.bro (Ruoming Pang).

- Bogus error message "Can't install default pcap filter" when using -F
  removed.


0.8a70 Sun Feb  8 14:19:45 PST 2004

- Bro has a new home page at

	http://www-nrg.ee.lbl.gov/bro.html

  It includes a "wish list" of Bro development projects:

	http://www-nrg.ee.lbl.gov/bro-wishlist.html

- The "match" expression has been completely overhauled (Umesh Shankar).
  It now has the syntax:

	match EXPR1 using EXPR2

  Its semantics are complicated, but it's very powerful (see its use for
  alert filtering below).  EXPR1 can have any type T.  EXPR2 must be of
  type "set[R]", where R is a record type.  R must have the following fields:

	$pred	- type is "function(T): bool".  This is the predicate
		  associated with the record.  It is passed in EXPR1's
		  value and returns true or false.

	$result	- can have any type T'.  This is the value to use when
		  if $pred returns true for EXPR1.

	$priority - type must be arithmetic (count, int, double).  This
		  is the priority associated with the match of EXPR1
		  if $pred returns true.

  The way the expression works is that EXPR1 is evaluated yielding a
  value V.  EXPR2 is then evaluated yielding a set of records whose
  type includes the above fields.  Bro then spins through each of the
  records in the set and tests whether its $pred predicate holds for V.
  If so, it records the given $result and the associated $priority.
  It then returns for the value of the entire expression the $result
  with the highest $priority.

  Here's an example.  The following script:

	global match_stuff = {
		[$pred = function(a: count): bool { return a > 5; },
		 $result = "it's big",
		 $priority = 2],

		[$pred = function(a: count): bool { return a > 15; },
		 $result = "it's really big",
		 $priority = 3],

		[$pred = function(a: count): bool { return T; },
		 $result = "default",
		 $priority = 0],
	};

	print match 0 using match_stuff;
	print match 10 using match_stuff;
	print match 20 using match_stuff;

  when executed will print:

	default
	it's big
	it's really big

  (Note that Bro actually will first evalute $priority before evaluating
  $pred, and if it already has a better (higher) priority result, it
  will not bother calling $pred.)

- There's a new syntax for designating function values (Umesh Shankar).
  It currently only works when associating a function value with a
  record field in a record constructor:

	[$foo(bad_guy: addr) = { launch_counter_DDOS(bad_guy); return 3.14; }]

  is equivalent to:

	[$foo = function(bad_guy: addr): double = {
			launch_counter_DDOS(bad_guy);
			return 3.14;
	}]

  The goal is to make such functions easier on the eye to express.
  The changes are (1) no "function" keywork necessary, (2) no function
  return type necessary (note, it is inferred from the "return" statement
  in the function body; eventually this will work for all functions, not
  just those in record constructors), (3) the '=' sign comes after the ')'
  rather than before the keyword "function".

  Given this syntax, we can rewrite the initialization of match_stuff
  in the example above as:

	global match_stuff = {
		[$pred(a: count) = { return a > 5; },
		 $result = "it's big",
		 $priority = 2],

		[$pred(a: count) = { return a > 15; },
		 $result = "it's really big",
		 $priority = 3],

		[$pred(a: count) = { return T; },
		 $result = "default",
		 $priority = 0],
	};

- The motivation behind these elaborate new mechanisms is to provide a
  powerful and streamlined way to filter alerts.  According, alert.bro
  now processes any alerts generated via ALERT() through a new global,
  alert_policy.  alert_policy's type is set[alert_policy_item], where
  alert_policy_item is:

	type alert_policy_item: record {
		result: AlertAction;
		pred: function(a: alert_info): bool;
		priority: count;
	};

  The idea is that you specify your alert post-filtering by redef'ing
  new elements into alert_policy.  For example, here are two post-filtering
  rules used at LBL to weed out uninteresting alerts:

	# Ignore connections marked as sensitive because they're
	# NTP to otherwise-sensitive hosts (first clause) or they happen
	# to involve 2766/tcp (Solaris Listen), which happens frequently
	# to ftp.ee.lbl.gov if Bro misses the PORT negotiation.
	[$pred(a: alert_info) =
		{
		return a$alert == SensitiveConnection &&
			(a$conn$id$resp_p == 123/udp || # NTP
			 a$msg == /Solaris listen service/);
		},
	 $result = ALERT_FILE,
	 $priority = 1],


	# Ignore sensitive URIs if the request was unsuccessful (code 404,
	# or not answered.)
	[$pred(a: alert_info) =
		{
		return a$alert == HTTP::HTTP_SensitiveURI &&
			a$msg == /.*((\(404)|(no reply)).*/;
		},
	 $result = ALERT_FILE,
	 $priority = 1],

  These rules are part of:

	redef alert_policy += {
		... these records and others ...
	};

  The idea behind them is to demote certain alerts that would ordinarily
  be syslog'd (i.e., the associated action is ALERT_LOG_ALWAYS) to instead
  just be recorded in the alert.$BRO_ID file.  Naturally, there are
  many other possibilities.  For example:

	[$pred(a: alert_info) = {
		if ( a$alert == FTP::FTP_Sensitive &&
		     a$msg == /.*crown_jewels.*/ )
			{
			system("page_the_duty_officer \"crown jewels theft!\"");
			return T;
			}
		else
			return F;
		},
	$result = ALERT_LOG_ALWAYS,
	$priority = 1000],

  would run the program page_the_duty_officer with the argument "crown
  jewels theft!" if an FTP_Sensitive alert was generated and the log message
  included the text "crown_jewels".  More generally, post-filtering needn't
  just be about deciding on how the alert is logged; the processing can
  run programs, update tables, etc., just like any other function call might.

- You can use the new function tally_alert_type in an alert_action_filters
  initialization in order to suppress immediate logging of an alert and
  instead have Bro generate a summary of how many times the given alert
  was seen when it exits.  You can use another new function, file_alert,
  to specify an alert_action_filters initialization that causes the alerts
  to just be written to the alert.$BRO_ID file but not otherwise logged.

  For example:

	redef alert_action_filters += {
		# Just summarize various packet capture glitches.
		[[RetransmissionInconsistency, ContentGap, DroppedPackets,
		  AckAboveHole]] =
			tally_alert_type,

		[RemoteWorm] = file_alert,
	};

  would specify that RetransmissionInconsistency (etc.) alerts should just
  be reported in the log file (log.$BRO_ID) as a total count, and
  RemoteWorm should only be put in the alert.$BRO_ID file, but not
  otherwise logged or counted.

  You could get the same functionality by writing alert_policy records,
  but they're quite a bit bulkier than the above.  Note that
  alert_action_filters entries take precedence over alert_policy
  records, but are evaluated *after* the "match" on alert_policy,
  so if you have predicates in alert_policy with side-effects (like the
  invocation of page_the_duty_officer in the example above), those
  will still happen.

- The alert_info record (which is used in calls to ALERT) now has
  slots for some more additional information:

	user: string;	# can hold an assocaited username
	filename: string;	# an associated filename
	method: string;	# associated HTTP method
	URL: string;	# associated URL
	n: count;	# any associated count/number/status code

  (These are all &optional, so you don't need to specify them if they're
  not appropriate.)  A number of ALERT's in the default policy scripts
  have been changed to include these.  The intent is to add more such
  information in the future.  Ideally, alert_policy records shouldn't
  be doing checks like "a$msg == /.*((\(404)|(no reply)).*/" but instead
  extracting the status code directly from a field of 'a' (which is an
  alert_info record).

- ALERT now fills in the '$id' field in the alert_info record with
  the $id of the associated connection, if the caller didn't suppy
  a $id but did supply a $conn.  Likewise, it will fill in $src with
  the $orig_h from $id (after first filling in $id).  The net result
  is that you can rely on $id and $src being set for any alert that
  has an associated connection.

- The HTTP analysis scripts (policy/http*.bro) have been converted to
  use the "module" facility, similar to how ftp.bro was converted for
  0.8a48.  This may require changing some of your own scripts, generally
  just to add "HTTP::" qualifiers.

- Now that the variables associated with FTP analysis are part of an
  "FTP" module, the "ftp_" prefix associated with:

	ftp_excessive_filename_len
	ftp_excessive_filename_trunc_len
	ftp_guest_ids
	ftp_hot_cmds
	ftp_hot_files
	ftp_hot_guest_files
	ftp_ignore_invalid_PORT
	ftp_ignore_privileged_PASVs
	ftp_log
	ftp_skip_hot

  has been removed, and these are now called:

	excessive_filename_len
	excessive_filename_trunc_len
	guest_ids
	hot_cmds
	hot_files
	hot_guest_files
	ignore_invalid_PORT
	ignore_privileged_PASVs
	log_file
	skip_hot

  To get to them from other scripts, you specify, for example,

	redef FTP::guest_ids = { .... };

  whereas before you had to use:

	redef FTP::ftp_guest_ids = { .... };

- The new connection logging format introduced in 0.8a57 is now the
  default, unless you redef the new variable "traditional_conn_format"
  to be T (Robin Sommer).  Connections using unidentified ephemeral
  ports now have a service of simply "other" rather than other-XXXX.
  The 'U' connection status flag has been removed (unless you're using
  traditional_conn_format).

- Tables can now be directly indexed by records, and indexing using records
  is no longer interchangeable with using a corresponding list of indices
  (Umesh Shankar).  This may require adjustments to existing policy
  scripts.

- Hostnames such as www.google.com now have type set[addr] rather than
  a funky internal list type.

- The new function dump_current_packet(file_name: string) dumps a copy of
  the current packet to the file with the given name, appending it if the
  file already exists (Robin Sommer).  The file is in tcpdump format.
  A handy use for this is in an event handler for signature_match(),
  to record packets that match given signatures.

- The event new_packet() is invoked for each new packet (Robin Sommer).
  It currently doesn't provide the packet contents but soon will in
  a fashion similar to secondary-filter.bro.

- "cf -f fmt" specifies a strtime() format.  -u specifics UTC time rather
  than local time (Mark Delow and Craig Leres).  cf now has a man page
  (Craig Leres).

- Two new variables, backdoor_ignore_local and backdoor_ignore_remote,
  can be used to specify backdoor signatures that should be ignored
  if the server is local/remote.

- A bug has been fixed in which a "next" executed in the final iteration
  of a for loop would mangle the subsequent processing of the outer
  statements (Chema Gonzalez).

- Bug fixes for MIME and Base64 processing (Ruoming Pang).

- pcap.bro now builds its filter in the opposite order (restrict_filters
  first), which can improve packet filtering performance (Robin Sommer).

- A bug in &default has been fixed.

- More SSL autoconf tweaks (Robin Sommer).

- Portability for different pcap_compile_nopcap() calling sequences
  (Chema Gonzalez).

- Some tweaks for a minor reduction in memory consumption.

- A memory leak for secondary packet filters has been fixed.

- The localization of error messages (what script line they correspond to)
  has been improved.


0.8a58 Tue Dec 16 08:55:47 PST 2003

- Compatibility with older versions of libpcap (Chema Gonzalez).


0.8a57 Tue Dec  9 10:14:30 PST 2003

- The format of Bro's connection summaries is changing.  The new format
  looks like

	  1069437569.904605 0.230644 1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8 http 59377 80 tcp 610 275 S3 L

  That is, <timestamp>, <duration>, <originator address>, <responder address>,
  <service>, <originator port>, <responder port>, <originator bytes>,
  <responder bytes>, <connection state>, <flags>.  (Robin Sommer)

  The script variable traditional_conn_format=T specifies to use the old
  format rather than this new one.  This is *currently* the default, but
  will change soon to default to F instead.  If you have comments on this
  new format, we'd like to hear them.

- The SigAction's available in signatures.bro have been extended (Robin Sommer).
  SIG_FILE_BUT_NO_SCAN is like SIG_FILE but without any horizontal/vertical
  processing; SIG_LOG_ONCE logs only an alert only the first time it occurs;
  SIG_LOG_PER_ORIG logs only the first instance of an alert generated by a
  particular originator; SIG_COUNT has been renamed SIG_COUNT_PER_RESP; and
  SIG_SUMMARY suppresses logging of individual alerts but generates a
  per-originator summary.

- A new -p option for snort2bro tells it to only process signatures that
  include matching on payload (Robin Sommer).

- You can now explicitly include or exclude particular SIDs when
  running snort2bro by specifying a configuration file via -c (Robin
  Sommer).  The format is simple, just "include" or "ignore" followed
  by the SID number:

	# sid-526 BAD TRAFFIC data in TCP SYN packet
	ignore	526

	# sid-623 matches a null-flags stealth scan.  Include it even
	# if we build with -p, since it doesn't tend to generate any
	# false positives.
	include	623

  The new "snort2bro.cfg" file gives examples (i.e., the above).

- Bro can now serialize functions and event handlers, meaning that these
  can be passed as values between Bro's and dumped using -g (Robin Sommer).
  One of the main goals in supporting this is to allow in situ alteration
  of the Bro's configuration (e.g., you can edit a function and change its
  functioning and have a running Bro pick up the change without having to
  stop and be restarted).  Such dynamic reconfiguration is experimentally
  supported via -g <dir> (see below).

- &persistent state is now stored in the *directory* given by state_dir
  (default: "./.state"), one file per variable, rather than a single file
  (Robin Sommer).

- Storing &persistent state to disk is now done incrementally: after writing
  each file, there's a delay of state_write_delay (default: 0.1 secs) before
  working on the next file (Robin Sommer). This may introduce small
  inconsistencies, but prevents load spikes that can lead to packet drops.
  Currently, there is no mechanism to incrementally store a single variable
  (like a large table), although there is already some framework in place
  to eventually support this.

- The *experimental* new -g <dir> option dumps the script-level configuration
  (excluding things defined in internal default scripts like bro.init)
  into the directory <dir>. These files may be printed with "bro -x <file>",
  or copied into the state_dir of a running Bro, which will then pick up
  the change if it has loaded checkpoint.bro.  (When picking up changes,
  event handlers are always added, while functions, types, and variables
  replace the current ones).

- Table values are now incrementally expired rather than all at once
  (Robin Sommer).  That is, if the expiration timer goes off and hundreds
  of values should now be expired, the work of doing so is spread over
  chunks of table_expire_size (default: 50) at a time, separated by a
  delay of table_expire_delay (default: 0.1 secs).  This change aims to
  prevent large processing spikes that can lead to packet drops.

- New built-ins sub() and gsub() act like awk's functions of the same
  name, changing substrings (either first, or all) that match a given
  regular expression to a given target string.  (Note, the calling sequence
  differs from the order used by awk.)

- The new auxiliary script aux/scripts/mvlog is a handy way to manage
  checkpointed logs.  See the script for documentation.

- The &expire_func function now takes two arguments.  The second is
  of type "any" and corresponds to the index(es) of the element being
  expired.  To access the individual indices, you use a new assignment form:

	[a, b, c] = index_val;

  (where index_val is the second argument of type "any").  This assigns
  a to the first index, b to the second, and c to the third.  NOTE: the
  use of "any" types here is *temporary* and will be changing in the
  future to a general "tuple" notion.  (Robin Sommer)

- scan.bro and conn.bro have been reworked to consume less memory and to
  support more flexible state expiration (Robin Sommer).

- The new builtin rescan_state() causes Bro to re-read any persistent
  data values (Robin Sommer).

- snort2bro now supports continued lines ("\<newline>") (Robin Sommer).

- The calling sequences of the software_version_found() and
  software_parse_error() events has changed, and a new event,
  software_unparsed_version_found(), is invoked for raw version
  strings (i.e., the version string prior to the event engine
  attempting to parse it into version/major/minor) (Robin Sommer).

- Software version tracking for clients now tracks all versions, not just
  the latest version (Robin Sommer).

- alert_info records now include an optional field event_src, which is the
  source of the event if it was received from an external Bro (Robin Sommer).

- Regular expressions now support {} iteration values of 0, and generate
  better error messages.

- Output generated by icmp.bro is now redirected into an "icmp" log file
  (Robin Sommer).

- autoconf tweaks for configuring OpenSSL on Linux (Ruoming Pang, Robin Sommer).
  Tested on RedHat (thanks to Anton Chuvakin), Debian, FreeBSD, Solaris.

- You can now turn off using OpenSSL even if the OS supports it, via
  configuring with --disable-openssl (Robin Sommer).

- Variable size computations (per global_sizes()) are now more accurate
  (Robin Sommer).

- A bug with combining file encryption and log rotation has been
  fixed (Robin Sommer).

- A problem tracking directionality in signatures fixed (Robin Sommer).

- Bro now continues running if DNS is not functioning (Robin Sommer).

- Rewriter memory use has been significantly reduced (Ruoming Pang).

- Some bugs with -A/-w interaction have been fixed (Ruoming Pang).


0.8a48 Tue Oct 21 15:56:13 PDT 2003

- There is now a mechanism in place for multiple Bro's to communicate with
  one another via sockets (Robin Sommer).  *This is quite experimental at
  this point* and may have significant bugs and/or need significant
  enhancements.

  By loading listen-clear.bro or listen-ssl.bro, an instance of Bro starts
  to listen on a TCP port.  The first of these listens for unencrypted
  connections and the second for connections encrypted via OpenSSL.  To
  connect to a listening Bro, you load remote-clear.bro or remote-ssl.bro.
  For this connection, you specify which events you want to receive by
  giving a regular expression (e.g.  "/http_*/" for all HTTP events),
  although only those events for which you have defined a local handler
  are actually requested.  Communication is uni-directional in the sense
  that for a certain connection the events go only from Bro-A to Bro-B but
  not from B to A (you could set up a second connection for the other
  direction, though).

  The OpenSSL certificate used to authorize remote  Bro's is specified in
  the script variable "ssl_ca_certificate" and the private key and certificate
  for the local Bro via "ssl_private_key".

  If Bro A connects to Bro B, by default it sends over its capture_filter.
  But Bro B uses it only if it has loaded remote-pcap.bro.  This is the
  beginning of structuring inter-Bro trust mechanisms.  It is done via two
  new events, remote_capture_filter(ip: addr, p: port, filter: string) and
  send_capture_filter(ip: addr, p: port, s: string) : bool.

  The implementation forks a second process which does the socket
  communication, so that the main process should not be affected too much.
  The two processes communicate via a pipe.

  You can call is_remote_event() to determine whether the event currently
  being handled was originated by a remote Bro (if T) or the local Bro
  (if F).

  If a connection with a remote Bro terminates (for whatever reason), Bro
  may try to reconnect automatically.

  A new function, get_event_source(), returns a record event_source
  describing the source that raised the last event.

  See doc/ssl.txt for an explanation of how to create the keys/certificates.

- A fledgling Gnutella analyzer has been contributed (Mark Allman).
  It generates the following events:

	event gnutella_text_msg(c: connection, orig: bool, headers: string)
	event gnutella_binary_msg(c: connection, orig: bool, msg_type: count,
					ttl: count, hops: count, msg_len: count,
					payload: string, payload_len: count,
					trunc: bool, complete: bool)
	event gnutella_partial_binary_msg(c: connection, orig: bool,
						msg: string, len: count)
	event gnutella_establish(c: connection)
	event gnutella_not_establish(c: connection)
	event gnutella_http_notify(c: connection)

- Bro now supports a secondary channel for acquiring packets (Chema Gonzalez).
  You access it by redef'ing the new global "secondary_filters", adding
  table[string] of event(filter: string, pkt: pkt_hdr).  The string
  specifies a tcpdump filter; anytime a packet matches the filter
  (including packets that would *not* otherwise be matched by
  capture_filter), then the given event handler is invoked.

  For example,

	  redef secondary_filters += {
		  ["tcp[13] & 7 != 0"] = rst_syn_fin_flag,
	  }

  will invoke rst_syn_fin_flag() anytime a TCP packet is seen for
  which the SYN/FIN/RST bits are non-zero.  The event handler will
  be passed the string "tcp[13] & 7 != 0" (so it can tell which
  of possibly multiple filters matched) and a pkt_hdr value, which
  includes the IP header and, if present, the TCP, UDP or ICMP header.

  Another example, and what motivated the addition, is:

	  redef secondary_filters += {
		["ip[10:2] & 0xffc == 0x398"] = sampled_1_in_1024_packet,
	  }

  which will invoke sampled_1_in_1024_packet() any time the given
  10 bits in the IP checksum match the pattern 0x398.  If the checksum
  field is uniformly distributed then this roughly corresponds to
  1-in-1024 random sampling.  (Chema has also developed BPF additions
  to support true random sampling.)

  See policy/secondary-filter.bro for examples.

- Bro now does a much better job of keeping track of how much memory
  has been allocated for different structures (Robin Sommer).

  This includes more accurate computations for global_size().

  In addition, if you redef "statistics_interval" to be a non-zero time
  interval, then with that periodicity a summary of memory usage (including
  memory used by event engine components) is dumped to the file
  "statistics_file".  In addition, at this point a "do_statistics" event
  is generated.  You can also call the new built-in statistics_update()
  to generate memory statistics on demand.

  The above structure is likely to change in the future.  statistics_interval
  will probably go away, to be replaced by either explicit calls to
  statistics_update() (which you can do on a timer if you like by using
  "schedule"), or by a built-in function that returns a record of all
  the statistics, that you can then format however you want.

- A major memory leak in HTTP analysis has been fixed (Ruoming Pang).

- New attributes &rotate = <interval expression> and
  &postprocessor = <string expression> can be associated with a file
  variable in order to specify how often the file should be rotated to a
  new filename on disk, and, when rotation occurs, the name of a shell
  program to run on the now-older version as a postprocessor (Robin Sommer).

- Similarly, log_postprocessor and log_rotate_interval specify the default
  values for files.  Unless redef'd, these themselves default to the empty
  string (= no postprocessing) and 0.0 seconds (no rotation).  (Robin Sommer)

- A new attribute, &encrypt, applies to variables of "file" type.  It specifies
  that the version on disk should be encrypted, using either the key specified
  as the value of the attribute, or, if no value is specified, using the
  value of the new script variable log_encryption_key.  The key is an OpenSSL
  public key; it's used to then embed a Blowfish session key.  (Robin Sommer)

  A new utility, aux/bdcat/bdcat ("Bro decrypt cat") can be used to decrypt
  the files.

- The internal structure of TCP analysis has been significantly altered.
  Previously, TCP_Endpoint tracked endpoint state and TCP_EndpointContents
  (derived from it) did stream reassembly.  These have now been separated;
  TCP_Endpoint still tracks endpoint state, but TCP_EndointContents has
  become TCP_Contents, and is only loosely coupled with TCP_Endpoint.
  The reason for this change is to lay the groundwork for (1) applying
  an application analyzer to a connection after several packets for
  the connection have already been read, and (2) applying *multiple*
  application analyzers to a single connection.

- Bro now supports the universal hashing if USE_UHASH is defined
  (Ruoming Pang).  Universal hashing is a lighter-weight alternative
  to MD5 hashing that retains the property of being very difficult
  for an attacker to guess.  It comes in two flavors, a 32-bit
  version (which you get with USE_UHASH) and a faster 16-bit version
  (which you get if you also define USE_NH).  Bro will likely switch
  to using these by default in the near future, as their performance
  gain over MD5 is significant.

- New built-in functions srand() and rand() provide access to the
  usual C-style random number seeding & generation (Chema Gonzalez).

- You can now specify server/client addresses to leave in the clear in
  IP address anonymization (via the built-in variables preserve_orig_addr
  and preserve_resp_addr). Correspondingly, the built-in function for
  IP anonymization now takes a parameter to specify the type of the address
  (orig, resp, or other), instead of the method of anonymization
  (seq, random, prefix-preserving).  (Ruoming Pang)

- Trace anonymization now has prelminary support for handling TCP options
  via the new event "tcp_option" (Ruoming Pang).  It is only invoked
  if skip_event_tcp_option is F (it defaults to T).

- A new event, tcp_segment, is similar to the event "packet_content"
  but provides more information: is_orig (directionality), sequence
  number, and acknowledgement number (Ruoming Pang).

- ./configure finds OpenSSL if it's in some standard location.  Otherwise,
  you may specify it --with-openssl=<path>.  If OpenSSL is not available,
  Bro compiles cleanly without and gives warnings if a script tries use SSL.
  (Robin Sommer)

- The internal links in manual/entire.html have been fixed so they
  now work (Chema Gonzalez).

- A new policy script, blaster.bro, detects instances of the W32.Blaster
  worm (Robin Sommer).

- Signature files (for input to the signature engine) now reside in
  policy/sigs/*.sig.  This directory is now on the default $BROPATH.

- sig.ex.ssl-worm.bro and sig.ex.web-rules.bro have been updated
  to reflect changes in keywords (Robin Sommer).  They've been
  renamed to ex.ssl-worm.sig and ex.web-rules.sig and reside
  in policy/sigs/, per the above.

- The module facility has been changed to have its scope limited to
  the current file plus any additional files that are automatically
  processed based on its name plus $BRO_PREFIXES.

- As an experiment, ftp.bro has been modified to a style that includes
  using "module FTP".  Likely other policy scripts will be converted
  in the near future, and their variable names changed accordingly
  (e.g., "ftp_hot_files" will become "FTP::hot_files").

- The new "match" expression has been modified to allow any yield type
  rather than just strings.  It is likely to change significantly again
  soon.

- Iterating over multi-dimensional tables/sets now works (Robin Sommer).
  For example:

    const remote_peers_ssl : table[addr, port] of Peer &redef;
    [...]
    for ( [ip, p] in remote_peers_ssl )
        connect_ssl(ip, p, remote_peers_ssl[ip, p]$retry);

- Checkpointing of persistent state on SIGHUP now happens via bro.init
  (Robin Sommer).  Not tested.

- fmt() now supports %x for hexadecimal formatting (Chema Gonzalez).

- alert.bro logs the source for remote alerts; by redefining the new
  "event_source_description: string" locally, you can specify how a
  Bro is to refered to on the remote side.  (Robin Sommer)

- software.bro now tracks HTTP clients, too (Robin Sommer).  This
  will be extended in the near future.

- Some FreeBSD 5.X porting tweaks (Sergey Osokin).


0.8a37 Wed Sep  3 23:20:21 PDT 2003

- A new attribute, "&persistent", indicates that a global variable's
  state should persist on disk (Robin Sommer).  Currently, they
  reside in the file "state.bst".

  For example, given the following script:

	global a = 0 &persistent;

	event bro_init()
		{
		print ++a;
		}

  then every time you run it, a increases by one.

  You can dump the state file using "bro -x state.bst <scriptname>".
  (There's also a partially-implemented XML dumper which you invoke via
  "bro -X state.bst <scriptname>".)

  If you send Bro a HUP signal, then it will synchronize all persistent
  state to disk (checkpoint) at that point.  More generally, the policy
  script can do so at any time by calling the new built-in checkpoint_state().

  By including the new policy script "checkpoint", you can have Bro
  automatically checkpoint every time checkpoint_interval elapses
  (default 15 minutes).

- You can also record events to disk by loading the "capture-events"
  policy script, or calling the new capture_events() built-in (Robin Sommer).
  The events are written to the file events.bst.  You can dump these
  using bro -x (or -X), as above.  You can also replay them using
  "bro -R <file>".  By replaying them using the same policy script as
  generated them, you should get the same output.  For example:

	bro -r tracefile myscript capture-events

	...

	bro -R events.log myscript

- An experimental module facility has been added (Umesh Shankar).

  The module facility implements namespaces. Everything is in some namespace
  or other. The default namespace is called "GLOBAL" and is searched by
  default when doing name resolution. The scoping operator is "::" as in
  C++. You can only access things in the current namespace, things in the
  GLOBAL namespace, or things that have been explicitly exported from a
  different namespace. Exported variables and functions still require
  fully-qualified names. The syntax is as follows:

  module foo;  # Sets the current namespace to "foo"
  export {
	int i;
	int j;
  }
  int k;

  module bar;
  int i;

  foo::i = 1;
  bar::i = 2;
  print i;    # bar::i (since we're currently in module bar)
  j = 3;      # ERROR: j is exported, but the fully qualified name
              #        foo::j is required
  foo::k = 4; # ERROR: k is not exported

  The same goes for calling functions.

  One restriction currently in place is that variables not in the "GLOBAL"
  namespace can't shadow those in GLOBAL, so you can't have

    module GLOBAL;
    global i: int;

    module other_module;
    global i: int;

  It is a little confusing that the "global" declaration really only means
  that the variable i is global to the current module, not that it is truly
  global and thus visible everywhere (that would require that it be in
  GLOBAL, or if using the full name is ok, that it be exported).  Perhaps
  there will be a change to the syntax in the future to address this.

  The "module" statement cuts across @load commands, so that if you say:

	module foo;
	@load other_script;

  then other_script will be in module foo. Likewise if other_script changes
  to module bar, then the current module will be module bar even after
  other_script is done.  However, this functionality may change in the future
  if it proves problematic.

  The policy scripts in the Bro distribution have not yet been updated to
  use it, but there is a backward-compatibility feature so that existing
  scripts should work without modification. In particular, everything is
  put in GLOBAL by default.

- The hooks are now in place for communicating events between running
  Bro's.  An experimental implementation of doing so (written by Robin
  Sommer) will be integrated shortly.

- A side-effect of getting those hooks in place is that event handlers must
  now be directly specified (by naming them) rather than indirectly
  (for example, by indexing a table whose value yields an event handler).
  This may be fixed soon.

- An experimental "match" expression scans a list of predicates to find
  the first one that's both true and has the highest priority (Umesh Shankar).

  The general form is:

	match some_record on {
		[ priority, class_name, predicate ],
		...
	}

  where "predicate" is evaluated in the context of the value (and type) of
  some_record.  For example, if some_record has a field "num_alerts"
  then predicate could be "$num_alerts > 5".

  "priority" is a non-negative integer (i.e., of type "count"), and,
  for now, "class_name" is a string.

  For example,

	global c: conn_id;

	c = [ $orig_h = 0.0.0.0, $orig_p = 0/tcp,
	      $resp_h = 1.1.1.1, $resp_p = 1/tcp ];

	print match c on {
		[ 2, "emptyweb", $orig_h == 0.0.0.0 && $resp_p == 80/tcp ],
		[ 1, "emptyhost", $orig_h == 0.0.0.0 ],
		[ 0, "should not match", 1 == 0 ]
	};

  will print "emptyhost".

  The initial intent behind this is to eventually provide more flexible
  customization of alert processing, though it clearly has broader
  applicable.  *It is very likely that the semantics and perhaps the syntax
  of "match" will change in the near future.*

- Bro's packet filter is now computed via pcap.bro (which is automatically
  included via bro.init).  It uses two new built-ins:

	precompile_pcap_filter(id: PcapFilterID, s: string):  bool
	install_pcap_filter(id: PcapFilterID): bool

  The first is for precompiling a pcap filter so it can be installed
  or turned off dynamically. Associating an ID with the filter, you can
  then activate the filter by calling the second function (installing a
  new filter replaces the current one).  (Robin Sommer)

  Be default, pcap.bro is responsible for building a pcap string based on
  the capture/restrict_filters defined by the various analyzers. It compiles
  and installs this filter, so there is no observable difference in usage
  to the old implementation, except capture/restrict_filter are now *tables*
  rather than strings, and are written as plural rather than singular.
  So the analyzers need to define something like this:

	[finger.bro]
	redef capture_filters += { ["finger"] = "port finger" };

  This then allows "finger" to be used as the name for the corresponding
  filter element (see the next item).

- load-level.bro is an experimental policy script for allowing Bro to
  shed or add on load (in terms of which protocols it analyzes).  It
  provides three interface functions for setting the current loadlevel:

	# level is LoadLevel1, ..., LoadLevel10
	function set_load_level(level: PcapFilterID): bool

	function increase_load_level()
	function decrease_load_level()

  load-levels.bro defines ten different load levels (from 1 to 10, with 10
  being the one with the most load imposed on the system), which are
  configured by defining capture_load_level/restrict_load_levels: Example:

	redef capture_load_levels += {
		["dns"]          = LoadLevel1,
		["smtp"]         = LoadLevel2,
		["http-reply"]   = LoadLevel3,
		["http-request"] = LoadLevel8,
	};

  This means for example: "include the capture_filter associated with
  'http-reply' if the current load level is 3 or below".  There's a similar
  mechanism for restrict_filters:

	redef restrict_filters += {
		["cs-only"] = "net 131.159.0.0/16",
	};

	redef restrict_load_levels += {
		["cs-only"] = LoadLevel7,
	};

  This applies the given restrict_filter if the current load level is 7
  or *above*.

  The pcap filters belonging to the ten load levels are built and pre-compiled
  on startup. The three functions shown above just call install_pcap_filter()
  then.  (Robin Sommer)

- drop-adapt.bro tries to adjust the load level based on the current
  packet drop rate (Robin Sommer).

- synflood.bro is an experimental policy script for detecting SYN floods.
  It is not yet documented, other than brief comments in the script.
  (Robin Sommer)

- Subnet lookups now use Patricia trees instead of brute-force, which should
  make them significantly more efficient for large lists, e.g., local nets.
  (Robin Sommer)

- Due to the addition of modules, which use a C++-style "::" scope
  designator, you now need to use "0x" to introduce IPv6 address constants
  that use "::" to specify a series of empty octets.  For example, you
  used to be able to specify "deadbeef::cafe", but now this needs to be
  "0xdeadbeef::cafe".  Note that "1::2" can still be written without needing
  a "0x" prefix; it's just hex constants that start with letters that need
  the prefix.

- A new built-in, escape_string(), takes a string and returns a copy of
  it that uses escape sequences for any problematic characters (Robin Sommer).

- A number of low-level bug fixes and portability tweaks (Robin Sommer,
  Ruoming Pang, Christian Kreibich, Chema Gonzalez).

- A new timer, status_update_timer, fires for each ongoing connection
  every connection_status_update_interval seconds (default = 0 seconds,
  which means "don't fire).  (Robin Sommer)

- An additional Bro-level packet filter can filter/sample packets
  based on their src/dest ip/subnet (using a Patricia tree for
  efficiency; Robin Sommer). install_src_addr_filter(ip, flags, p) drops
  packets originating from ip with probability p (0..100) if none of the
  given TCP flags is set. install_src_net_filter, install_dst_addr_filter
  and install_dst_net_filter" work similarly.  The corresponding "uninstall_*"
  functions remove the filters again.

- The @if/@else/@endif mechanisms have been made more powerful (Robin Sommer).

- New configure option --enable-debug to compile without optimization
  (Robin Sommer).

- Small tweaks to the mpatrol support (Robin Sommer).

- SMTP is now one of the services which can use a small inactivity timeout
  in inactivity.bro (Robin Sommer).

- Alerts for signatures which are triggered by worms may be suppressed if
  we already know that the triggering host is indeed infected by a worm
  (Robin Sommer).

- Matches of a signature can now be counted per destination host
  (Robin Sommer).

- snort2bro now ignores sid-526 ("BAD TRAFFIC data in TCP SYN packet";
  Robin Sommer). Due to different semantics of Bro (matching stream-wise)
  and Snort (matching packet-wise) this signature generates a lot of
  false positives.


0.8a34 Sun Jul 13 09:11:32 PDT 2003

- The new "subnet" type corresponds to a CIDR prefix (Robin Sommer).
  You can use the '/' operator to convert an address to a subnet.  The
  "in" operator tests whether an address matches a subnet (e.g., "1.2.3.4
  in 1.2.255.255/16" yields T).

  You can index tables with index type "subnet" using addresses to retrieve
  the table entry with the longest-matching prefix for that address, and
  a number of tables/sets in the default scripts have been converted to
  this form.  So for example the local_16_nets and local_24_nets variables
  have been replaced by local_nets, which has type "set[subnet]",
  is_local_addr() now refers to it, and skip_scan_nets_{16,24} have
  likewise been consolidated into skip_scan_nets.

  One present deficiency is that subnets can't be used in tables/sets
  with multiple indices.  Fixing this is going to take some time ...
  Another deficiency is that the longest-match lookup is not very
  efficient.

  Caution: this feature has been only briefly tested with IPv6.

- ALERT now generates an event "alert_action" which includes the alert_info
  and AlertAction associated with an alert.  You can define your own handler
  to further customize alert processing.

- The "snort2bro" conversion utility has been extended to recognize some
  of the new Snort options (depth, distance, within; Robin Sommer).  For
  example:

      alert .... ( ... content:"|00 01 86 B8|";
		       content:"|00 00 00 02|"; distance:4; within:4;
		       content:"%x %x"; distance:16; within:256;
		       ... )

  is converted to:

      signature sid-1891 {
	  ...
	  payload /.*\x00\x01\x86\xB8.{4}\x00\x00\x00\x02.{16}.{0,251}%x %x/
	  }

  Note that not all of the new Snort options are supported yet.

- You can refer to script variables within signatures (Robin Sommer).
  For example, the following is now possible:

	signature sid-547 {
	  ip-proto == tcp
	  src-ip != local_nets
	  dst-ip == local_nets
	  dst-port == 21
	  event "FTP \"MKD  \" possible warez site"
	  tcp-state established
	  payload /[mM][kK][dD]  /
	  }

  This makes the signatures independent of the environment ("local_nets"
  in the above examle).  snort2bro now converts some well-known Snort
  variables into corresponding Bro variables, a number of which are listed
  in policy/site.bro.

- The default action for signature matches is now logging insted of only
  writing it to a file (Robin Sommer).

- You can now use the '^' and '$' regular expression operators inside
  subpatterns.  For example, /foo$/ | /^bar/ works now.

- You can now use "msec" for milliseconds (in addition to "usec" for
  microseconds, "sec" for seconds, etc).

- The log_file_name and open_log_file functions are now redef'able
  if you want to change their behavior.

- Bro now exits more cleanly upon exhaustion of memory (Robin Sommer).

- A bug was fixed for the case of getrlimit() returning RLIM_INFINITY for
  the maximum number of open files.

- Numerous additions of std:: scoping to address porting issues (Robin Sommer).

- gcc 3.X and Solaris portability fixes.

- A new event RemoteWorm is the complement of LocalWorm (Robin Sommer).

- A bug in which the FTP analyzer would complain about failing to be able
  to look up a connection has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- You can now configure Bro using "--with-mpatrol" to activate MPatrol
  debugging hooks.  When built in this mode, -m dumps the leak table
  and -M shows unfreed parts of the heap.  These dumps can also be
  triggered using SIGUSR1 / SIGUSR2, respectively.  (Robin Sommmer)

- A script function get_contents_type() which returns the type of reassembling
  being done for a connection (none/orig-side/resp-side/both; Robin Sommer).

- A minor bug fix for the regular expression matcher (Robin Sommer).


0.8a32 Thu Jun 12 23:33:21 PDT 2003

- The low-level hash functions have been reimplemented to use HMAC-MD5 to
  counter the "algorithmic complexity attacks" discussed in the USENIX
  Security 2003 paper by Scott Crosby & Dan Wallach
  (http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/) (Ruoming Pang and Vern Paxson)

- Ruoming Pang has made extensive changes to the anonymization/transformation
  framework.  A paper describing it will appear in SIGCOMM 2003, and will
  be included with the Bro distribution once the final copy is ready.

- Internal hash tables now resize incrementally, and more quickly.
  This makes a big difference in avoiding lengthy processing pauses when
  processing large volumes of traffic. (Craig Leres)

- gcc 3.1 and Linux portability tweaks.

- The calling sequence of http_request() has changed.  It now includes both
  the original URI and the escaped URI.  This was made explicit because
  we found that if only the original was passed in, it was too easy to forget
  to expand the escapes in it; and if only the escaped was passed in,
  some attacks could be missed. (Ruoming Pang)

- Signature rules can now refer to "finger" payload as well as HTTP and FTP
  (Robin Sommer).

- The signature engine now includes keywords "dst-ip", "dst-port",
  "ip-proto", "src-ip", "src-port".  (Robin Sommer)

- Packet sorting now defaults to off.

- The FTP analysis now attempts to track the current directory (Ruoming Pang).

- A number of scan detection additions have been added (Scott Campbell):

	activate_landmine_check = F
		if T, then access to more than landmine_thresh_trigger
		addresses in landmine_address (a set of addresses)
		constitutes a scan

	activate_priv_port_check = T
		if T, then inbound access to more than priv_scan_trigger
		privileged ports (i.e., ports < 1024) is considered a port
		scan.  You can exclude particular services from the count
		via troll_skip_service, which defaults to { smtp, ftp,
		ssh, 20/tcp, http }.

- The SMTP analysis now includes a new alert, HotEmailRecipient, which
  is triggered by mail sent to any of the addresses specified in
  the pattern hot_recipients (which defaults to a bare /@/).

- The new built-in cat_string_array_n() is like cat_string_array() except
  it takes starting and ending indices as additional arguments (Ruoming Pang).

- The new built-in sort_string_array() takes a string array and returns
  a sorted version (Ruoming Pang).  It currently uses an N^2 algorithm
  so shouldn't be used on large arrays.

- The new built-in subst() substitutes all instances of a given pattern
  in a given string with another string (Ruoming Pang).  For example,
  subst("fooboo", /oo/, "xxx") returns "fxxxbxxx".

- The new built-in cut_tail() trims characters from the end of a string
  (Ruoming Pang).  For example, cut_tail("fooboo", 2) returns "foob".

- sub_bytes() can now take a negative argument, which is with respect to
  the end of the string rather than the beginning (Ruoming Pang).

- The new built-in md5_hmac() returns an HMAC-MD5 hash of the given string
  (Ruoming Pang).  The HMAC secret key is generated from available entropy
  when Bro starts up, or it can be specified for repeatability using
  the new -K flag.

- The new built-in split_all() is like split() except that the returned
  array also includes the parts of the string that match the pattern
  used for the splitting (Ruoming Pang).

- The new built-in split_n() splits up to a given number of instances,
  optionally returning the parts matching the split pattern (Ruoming Pang).

- The new built-in split_complete() is the most general of the split functions
  (the others are written in terms of it).  It splits a given string
  with separators that appear in either a given pattern or a given set
  of strings, optionally including the text matching the separators in
  its return value, and optionally limiting the number of matches to
  a specified maximum.  (Ruoming Pang)

- The new built-in to_string_literal() returns an escaped version of a string
  suitable to feeding into Bro's parser.  For example, calling it on
  "foo\nbar" (where '\n' is an embedded newline) returns "foo\x0abar".
  (Ruoming Pang)

- subst_substring() has been renamed subst_string (Ruoming Pang).

- unescape_URI() no longer takes the connection as an argument (Ruoming Pang).

- config.guess and config.sub updated

- String escape expansion has been refined (Ruoming Pang) and some bugs
  fixed.  It now supports a format that's consistent with Bro string literals.

- Scanning of octal and hex escape sequences now stops after 3 or 2
  characters, respectively.  For example, "\0007" now expands to a
  NUL followed by the character '7'.  (Ruoming Pang)

- Bug fixes for handling of bare <CR> and <LF>'s when <CRLF> expected
  (Ruoming Pang), and associated "weird" events.

- A bug in signature matching reassembly has been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- A bug in reporting "bad connection size" for connection sizes > 2GB
  has been fixed.

- A bug in computing sizes for large partial connections has been fixed.

- A bug in delayed generation of connection closed events has been fixed.

- A framework has been added for compression of some "weird" events
  to only be generated once-per-connection (Ruoming Pang).

- Some of the "weird"'s generated by the HTTP analyzer have been regularized.

- Some memory management fixes.

- A performance problem in allocating List objects was fixed.

- The copyright dates have been updated (Craig Leres).


0.8a22 Wed Jan 15 16:47:18 PST 2003

- There is now a "conditional compilation" feature similar to C's preprocessor
  (contributed by Robin Sommer).  "@if (expr)" will include the remaining
  input lines up to "@endif" only if the given expression evaluates to true.
  "@ifdef (id)" will do so only if the given identifier has been defined,
  and "@ifndef (id)" only if it has not been defined.  There's currently
  no "@else" directive, and conditionals cannot be nested.  Both of these
  will be added in the future.

- New built-in functions (contributed by Ruoming Pang): parse_dotted_addr
  takes a string in A1.A2.A3.A4 form an returns a corresponding "addr" value.
  unescape_URI takes a URI that possibly has embedded escape sequences
  ("%61" for 'a') and expands the sequences.

- The URIs in HTTP requests are no longer automaticaly escaped.  Instead,
  they need to be manually escaped using unescape_URI.  As this is likely
  error-prone (users forgetting to do so), the plan is to change the
  calling sequence of http_request in the near future so that *both* the
  escaped and the unescaped URI are passed in.

- A number of g++ 3.0 porting tweaks have been added (thanks to Sean Irvine).

- The term "rule" has been systematically changed to "signature" (Robin Sommer).

- The functionality of monitoring packet drops has been moved into its
  own policy script, netstats.bro (Robin Sommer).

- A number of rewriter and location bugs have been fixed.

- Some missing HTTP "weird"'s have now been included in weird.bro.


0.8a21 Thu Nov 28 23:31:38 PST 2002

- A new mechanism will reorder packets within a window of packet_sort_window
  if due to their sequence numbers they appear to be out of order.  This
  can help a great deal when reading from multiple NICs.  (Contributed by
  Ruoming Pang.)

- A bug in regular-expression matching in which for example
  "2a1" == /[0-9]+/ would evaluate as true was fixed (Ruoming Pang).

- There's now a rewriter/anonymizer for FTP (Ruoming Pang).

- The rewriter/transformation framework now supports a notion of
  delaying transformation decisions until later (Ruoming Pang).

- An incompatibility with bison 1.75 has been identified.  The problem
  is that bison 1.75 generates incomplete location information for empty
  grammar productions (those for which the RHS is empty).  This will
  be fixed soon.

- Some bugs in the signature engine have been fixed (Robin Sommer).

- The sources no longer use the not-fully-portable hash_map template
  (Umesh Shankar).

- Some bugs with the debugger getting confused about source line number
  locations, and also with the -t option, have been fixed (Umesh Shankar).

- If a content gap occurs wholly inside an HTTP entity, then the analyzer
  will skip over the entity and continue processing any subseqeuent HTTP
  items, rather than giving up on processing the connection (Ruoming Pang).

- The following new built-in functions have been contributed by
  Ruoming Pang:

	function cat_string_array(a: string_array): string
	function split_all(str: string, re: pattern): string_array
	function strstr(big: string, little: string): count
	function subst_substring(s: string, from: string, to: string): string
	function int_to_count(n: int): count
	function fmt_ftp_port(a: addr, p: port): string


0.8a20 Sun Nov 17 20:09:31 PST 2002

- This is the first "public" Bro release (one accessible directly via
  the Web).  The README has been correspondingly updated.

- The user manual has been significantly expanded, and source for it is
  now included in the release.

- Some "active mapping" bug fixes (contributed by Umesh Shankar).

- The configuration script now checks for the presence of the necessary
  BIND libraries/headers, and also for bogus --enable options (contributed
  by Craig Leres).

- backdoor.bro now includes a tcpdump filter for detecting (some) KaZaA
  traffic.

- http-reply.bro now tracks the sizes of request/response entities.

- http-request.bro now treats an URL accessing variants of /etc/netconfig
  as sensitive.


0.8a18 Sun Oct 27 15:28:23 PST 2002

- Improvements to the performance of the SMTP analyzer (Ruoming Pang).
  A new function, skip_smtp_data, skips over the content of an SMTP
  message.

- If you're doing trace rewriting and specify -w but don't specify -A,
  then the rewritten traffic goes to the -w save file, along with the
  usual non-transformed traffic (Ruoming Pang).  If a connection is
  being transformed (which is specified by the new rewriting_smtp_trace
  and rewriting_http_trace globals), then only its transformed packets
  are written to the -w file; not the original packets.  This allows
  a potentially large degree of trace compression.  There's also a
  new variable omit_rewrite_place_holder, which directs that when rewriting
  a trace, packets that are placeholders for now-missing packets (because
  you've excised content) are *not* generated.  This diminishes the
  timing fidelity of the transformed trace, but also can save a large
  amount of space.

- SMTP relay analysis is now standalone from regular SMTP analysis
  (Ruoming Pang).

- Some memory management and error propagation fixes (Ruoming Pang and
  Vern Paxson).


0.8a16 Wed Oct 23 23:48:40 PDT 2002

- "--enable-brov6" was broken by some recent changes.  It now works again.

- Some "make distclean" tweaks.

- Error checking for "redef enum".


0.8a15 Tue Oct 22 00:02:51 PDT 2002

- Fixed Makefile bug which left out wide-spread dependencies on
  event.bif.netvar_h.


0.8a14 Mon Oct 21 01:16:46 PDT 2002

- The "add" statement has been implemented.  This allows you to add
  elements to sets.  A bunch of policy scripts that used to use
  "table [] of bool"'s for this purpose have been modified to instead
  use sets.

- You can now extend the elements of an enum using "redef enum foo += { ... }"
  where the additional names are listed in the braces (contributed by
  Umesh Shankar).  A number of policy scripts have been tweaked to use
  this for the (fairly) new Alert enum.  This allows you to create new
  Alert's without alert.bro having to know about them.

- Some bugs in identifying error locations have been fixed.

- -A now supports anonymizing IP addresses (contributed by Ruoming Pang).
  This includes four new functions: preserve_prefix, preserve_subnet, and
  preserve_net (which direct that the corresponding prefix/net/subnet
  not be anonymized) and anonymize_addr (which returns the anonymized
  version of the given address.

- Some bugs in HTTP -A have been fixed (thanks to Ruoming Pang).

- The beginnings of support for CIDR prefixes has been added by
  Ruoming Pang.

- Porting tweaks (use of map's rather than hash_map's, courtesy of
  Umesh Shankar; libedit comments fixed).

- http-detail.bro has gone away.

- Some more copyright and $Header -> $Id fixes.

- There is now a function string_cat() which concatenates two strings
  and returns the result (contributed by Ruoming Pang).  This function
  is useful in place of the regular cat() because the latter will
  expand escape sequences etc.  It probably shouldn't, and that may
  change in the future.


0.8a11 Sun Oct 13 10:53:07 PDT 2002

- The framework for defining built-in functions has been extended
  so it's also now the way to specify the interface to event handlers.
  See event.bif.  (Contributed by Ruoming Pang)

- A new policy script, http-abstract.bro, can be loaded when doing HTTP
  transformation (via http-rewriter.bro), contributed by Ruoming Pang.
  It trims HTTP text responses to the first "http_abstract_max_length" bytes.

- A new built-in, skip_http_entity_data, specifies that the entity
  associated with the current HTTP request/response should be skipped
  (Ruoming Pang).

- More changes have been made to the mechanisms for tracking source
  file locations in order to pinpoint error messages.  If you encounter
  problems, please let me know.

- If you try to configure but your resolve library lacks res_mkquery(),
  this is now a fatal error (Craig Leres).  Ideally, someone will modify
  DNS_Mgr.cc to work even if only blocking DNS is available ...

- In most (not all, yet) of the sources, the copyright notices have
  been updated, $Header has been changed to $Id, and config.h is included
  (Craig Leres).


0.8a10 Tue Oct  8 16:05:42 PDT 2002

- The way that Bro tracks the source-file location associated with
  different objects has been tweaked, with a resulting savings of
  about 10% in Bro's memory use and a smidgen of CPU time, too.

- Built-in functions now are better about identifying source-file locations
  associated with errors.

- The http.$BRO_ID log file format has changed to no longer track
  individual request streams.  (So it is now closer to how it used
  to operate in 0.7.)

- The autoconf setup has been tweaked so that you use:

	--enable-brov6              enable IPV6 processing
	--enable-activemapping      enable active mapping processing
	--enable-expire-dfa-states  enable DFA state expiration

  rather than --with-XXX as was the case in 0.8a9.


0.8a9 Mon Oct  7 10:15:12 PDT 2002

- A bunch of configuration/autoconf/portability tweaks (Craig Leres).
  These include compiling under Solaris.

  When running ../configure, you can now specify:

	--with-brov6              enable IPV6 processing
	--with-activemapping      enable active mapping processing
	--with-expire-dfa-states  enable DFA state expiration

  You no longer set these via editing the Makefile.

- Some bugs with HTTP 1.0 keep-alive connections fixed (Ruoming Pang).

- The "hf" suite of utilities is no longer distributed in aux/.  Instead,
  get it directly from ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/hf.tar.gz.

- bro_logchk has been renamed bro-logchk.pl and is now distributed in aux/
  (it was supposed to be before, but was inadvertantly left out of the list
  of distribution files).


0.8a7 Fri Oct  4 22:24:30 PDT 2002

- HTTP reply analysis has been split into a number of policy script files:

	http-body.bro
	http-detail.bro
	http-entity.bro
	http-event.bro
	http-header.bro
	http-reply.bro
	http-rewriter.bro

  so you can readily trade off how detailed the HTTP processing is vs.
  the CPU/memory it consumes (contributed by Ruoming Pang).

- Bro now generates login_prompt events when the $TTYPROMPT environment
  variable is passed during a login session, in order to detect the
  recently publicized Solaris remote /bin/login exploit.

- Ruoming Pang has extended the framework for defining "rewriter" functions
  to now also serve as the way to define general built-in functions.

- bro.init has been rearranged to have a more logical structure (courtesy
  of Ruoming Pang).

- Craig Leres contributed a number of portability & autoconf tweaks.

- Craig Leres has extended nb_dns.{h,c} to support IPv6 DNS lookups.
  Bro does not yet take advantage of these extensions.

- The beginnings of portability to gcc 3.2 were added.  There unfortunately
  is more work to do here!

- The README has finally been updated to have more correspondence with
  the 0.8 release.


0.8a6 Wed Oct  2 18:58:12 PDT 2002

- Upgrade to autoconf 2.53 (Craig Leres).


0.8a5 Tue Oct  1 19:04:53 PDT 2002

- The regular expression matcher how has a mechanism to stop scanning when
  no further match is possible (Robin Sommer).  If you find problems with
  regular expression matching, especially if you're using EXPIRE_DFA_STATES,
  please let us know!

- Rule/signature files are now searched for using $BROPATH (Robin Sommer).
  In addition, you can define a list of signature files to incorporate
  using the new global "signature_files".  For example,

	redef signature_files += "web-stuff"

  will look for web-stuff and web-stuff.sig along $BROPATH.

- The tcp_deliver_undelivered variable is now tcp_match_undelivered and
  only applies to delivering otherwise-undelivered data to the signature
  matcher; such data is *not* delivered to any associated analyzer.
  (Robin Sommer)

- The framework for tracking version numbers now allows negative as
  well as positive versions (Robin Sommer).


0.8a4 Tue Oct  1 15:54:58 PDT 2002

- Support for extracting the contents of HTTP replies (and POST's),
  and for transforming/anonymizing HTTP traffic, contributed by Ruoming Pang.

- Some minor internal tweaks to the timer management to help track patterns
  of timer expiration.


0.8a3 Mon Sep 23 22:48:07 PDT 2002

- HTTP reply handling refined in policy scripts.

- New built-in functions to_int(), to_count() convert strings to
  integers/counts.

- Bug fixes for DNS_Mgr and IPv6.

- AckAboveHole alerts now ignored (just written to alert.$BRO_ID) by default.

- Packets belong to ignored connections (for example, partial connections if
  partial_connection_ok is false) are no longer recorded to the save file.

- Some minor formatting/naming tweaks.


0.8a1 Sat Sep 21 22:09:23 PDT 2002

- IPv6 support enabled if you build using -DBROv6.  Deficiencies: Bro
  doesn't yet look up hostnames for AAAA records; no handling of extension
  headers (if you have traces of these, please send them to me!); no
  handling of FTP PORT/PASV w/ IPv6 addresses (again, if you have traces,
  please send them!); DNS analyzer doesn't understand AAAA yet (again,
  please send me traces!); you have to change the capture_filter line
  in tcp.bro (as indicated in the script) in order to process TCP traffic,
  due to deficiencies in libpcap's support for IPv6.

- Bro is migrating towards a more structured way of handling log messages /
  alerts.  Analyzers now @load alert.bro, which has a function ALERT()
  for processing alerts.  Soon this function will provide a variety of
  filtering/processing hooks; expect changes.

- Bro now has an HTTP response analyzer (contributed by Ruoming Pang).
  The HTTP policy scripts have been split up into http.bro (just general
  definitions), http-request.bro (handles requests; loaded by http.bro),
  http-reply.bro (handles replies; you need to explicitly load this), and
  http-detail.bro (handles individual headers).  http-reply.bro will be
  undergoing some significant reworking in the near future; probably the
  scripts will be merged back into a single http.bro plus http-detail.bro.

- ssl-worm.bro contains a prototype policy script for detecting the
  Scalper SSL worm (contributed by Robin Sommer).  It uses the signature
  file sig.ex.ssl-worm.bro.  If someone has traces of Scalper in action
  to send us, that would be great.

- A new policy script, contents.bro, extracts the contents of each
  Bro connection into its own pair of files (one file for each
  direction).  Use in conjunction with -f or discarder_XXX() to
  extract specific connections.

- A new built-in function, strcmp(), returns the usual comparison between
  two strings (contributed by Robin Sommer).

- A new event, content_gap(), is generated when Bro detects that it is
  forced to skip over data in a reconstructed TCP stream because it is
  missing from the packet input.

- BIND8 is no longer included with the distribution.  If this causes you
  problems, let me know.

- aux/scripts/bro_logchk is a Perl script for parsing Bro HTTP & FTP logs
  (contributed by Jim Barlow).

- You can now compare addresses to see which is larger.  a < b means
  that in network order, the octets making up 'a' are ordered before
  those for 'b'.  E.g., 128.2.3.4 < 128.2.3.5 < 129.0.0.1.  Note that
  IPv4 addresses are all < IPv6 addresses (other than IPv4 addresses
  that are embedded in IPv6 addresses, e.g., ::128.2.3.4 < 128.2.3.5).

- Serious bug in TCP option handling fixed.

- Some bugs in CRLF handling fixed (courtesy Ruoming Pang).

- Bug in the implementation of &optional fixed.

- Bug in computing memory statistics when not reading packets (from
  an interface or the trace file) fixed.

- You can now include a trailing comma after the last item in an
  "enum" enumeration list.

- port-name.bro now maps 389/tcp to "ldap".

- A bug has been fixed in loading files multiple times


v0.7a175 Thu Aug 29 21:14:34 PDT 2002

- bro -s <file> reads in a *signature* file to search for regular expressions
  in packet payloads or TCP byte streams (written by Robin Sommer).
  See policy/rules.bro for an example of a policy script for processing
  the matches.

  Note that this feature is experimental, and will be evolving in the
  near future.

- The python script "snort2bro" reads in Snort signatures and translates
  them into Bro signature rules, suitable for processing using -s.

  An example of its operation is seen by running

	python snort2bro < sig.ex.web-rules.snort

  which, after reading in sig.ex.classification.config and
  sig.ex.reference.config, generates the output given in
  sig.ex.web-rules.bro, which is suitable to use as input to
  bro -s.

- bro -d invokes a gdb-like debugger (written by Umesh Shankar).  You can
  set breakpoints and watchpoints, examine tracebacks, print Bro expressions,
  and the like.  Type "help" for on-line help.

- bro -t <tracefile> turns on tracing of the policy script execution,
  written to the given file.

- Bro now includes an SMTP analyzer, which includes processing MIME
  message bodies (written by Ruoming Pang).  See smtp.bro and mime.bro
  for related policy scripts.  smtp.bro includes several experimental
  techniques for detecting mail relaying.

- You can now define enumerated types, such as

	type scanner_type: enum {
		SCANNER_STEALTH, SCANNER_HIGH_SPEED, SCANNER_AMBIGUOUS,
	};

  Enumerated types can be compared for equality with one another, and used
  as table indices, but cannot be converted to/from integers.

- bro -A <file> invokes an experimental, general trace transformation/
  anonymization framework (written by Ruoming Pang) which writes a modified
  tcpdump trace file from the input (which can be the network or another
  trace file) with potentially extensive modifications to the recorded
  packets.

  Transformers are built from .rw files (currently, {finger,ftp,ident,smtp}.rw),
  which are processed by the utility "rwcl" to generate both event engine
  analyzer components and rewriter policy scripts (for example, after
  configuring and building Bro, you'll find the scripts
  policy/{finger,ftp,ident,smtp}.rw.bro).

  See policy/smtp-rewriter.bro for an example of a policy script that
  performs transformation/anonymization.

- New built-ins:

	split(s: string, p: pattern): string_array;

	  takes a string and splits it into pieces at each occurrence of
	  the regular expression pattern p.  (The functionality is like
	  that in awk.)  It returns a string_array, which is a table[count]
	  of string that is indexed starting at 1, giving the different
	  pieces.

	  For example,

		split("foobar", /o/)

	  returns a 3-element table, for which [1] is the string "f",
	  [2] is the string "" (empty), and [3] is the string "bar".

	split1(s: string, p: pattern): string_array;

	  split1() does the same thing as split(), but only performs splitting
	  at the first occurrence, so it returns either a one-element table
	  (if the pattern doesn't appear in the string) or a two-element
	  table.  split1("foobar", /o/) returns a 2-element table for which
	  [1] is "f" and [2] is "obar".

	md5_hash(s: string): string

	  returns (in human-readable form) the MD5 hash of a given string.

	  So, for example,

		md5_hash("foobar")

	  yields "3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f".

	to_addr(s: string): addr

	  takes a string representing an address in "dotted quad" format
	  and returns the correponding "addr" value.

	set_buf(f: file, buffered: bool)

	  sets the given file to have its writes buffered or unbuffered
	  depending on the value of "buffered".  It does not return a value.

	connection_exists: function(c: conn_id): bool

	  returns T if the given connection identifier corresponds to a
	  currently instantiated connection (one for which the event engine
	  has state), F otherwise.

	lookup_connection(c: conn_id): connection

	  returns the "connection" record associated with the given
	  connection identifier, or a fatal run-time error if there
	  isn't one.

	set_inactivity_timeout(c: conn_id, timeout: interval): interval

	  sets the inactivity timeout for the given connection to the
	  given interval, returning the old interval.

	  If the interval is non-zero, then when no packets have been
	  processed for a connection after that much time has elapsed,
	  the connection is deleted, and an "inactivity_timeout" event
	  generated.

	get_matcher_stats(): matcher_stats

	  used for gathering statistics about the signature matcher

	rewriting_trace(): bool

	  returns T if -A was specified (anonymize/rewrite a trace),
	  F otherwise.

- New events:

	connection_state_remove(c: connection);

	  Invoked when the event engine has removed the connection from
	  its state.

	connection_SYN_packet(c: connection, pkt: SYN_packet);

	  Invoked for each SYN/SYN-ACK packet.

	connection_timeout(c: connection);

	  Invoked when the event engine times out a connection - for
	  example, because the originator sent a SYN that was never
	  answered, so the connection was never established.

	connection_reused: event(c: connection);

	  Invoked when the event engine decides that a new SYN for
	  an existing connection reflects a reuse of the connection
	  four-tuple, rather than belonging to the existing connection.

- New globals:

	const ignore_checksums = F &redef;

	  If true, then the event engine does not verify checksums (and
	  hence will not discard packets with bad checksums).

	const tcp_deliver_undelivered = F &redef;

	  If true, then when the event engine closes a connection, if
	  that connection has a chunk of data not yet delivered to its
	  analyzer (which only happens if the data is above a sequence
	  hole, indicating either a packet filter glitch or a protocol
	  botch), then the undelivered data will at that point be delivered
	  to the connection's analyzer.

	const tcp_reassembler_ports_orig: set[port] = {} &redef;
	const tcp_reassembler_ports_resp: set[port] = {} &redef;

	  Sets of ports for which, if a connection has the corresponding
	  originator/responder port, then the event engine will reassemble
	  the byte stream of the connection.

	  Normally, the event engine reassembles byte streams for any
	  connection for which there's an analyzer, and otherwise doesn't.
	  These variables can be used to force reassembly for the originator
	  or responder side (respectively) of connections for which there
	  isn't otherwise an analyzer.  This is useful when doing signature
	  matching on reassembled byte streams, for protocols that are
	  not otherwise analyzed by the event engine.

	const table_expire_interval = 1 min &redef;

	  How often to check table entries to see whether they've expired
	  (see &read_expire, etc., below).

	const requires_trace_commitment = F;

	  If true, then when rewriting/anonymizing traces, nothing will
	  actually be written to the edited trace file unless you call:

		rewrite_commit_trace(c: connection, commit: bool, future: bool)

	  If "future" is true, then future rewritten packets will be
	  automatically commited; otherwise, writing them to the trace
	  file requires another explicit rewrite_commit_trace() call.

	const inactivity_timeout = 0 secs &redef;

	  As noted above, when a connection becomes inactive, time it out
	  after this interval.  If 0 secs, then don't time it out.

- An SSH analyzer extracts SSH client/server version information.  See
  ssh.bro for the related policy script.

- There's now a (very) simple TFTP analyzer available in tftp.bro.

- You can now set the global "frag_timeout" to an interval which controls
  how long fragments are kept before discarding them (contributed by Ashley
  Thomas).  If you don't set the global, or set it to 0.0 sec, then fragments
  are kept around indefinitely.

- An implementation of an experimental anti-evasion technique, "active
  mapping", has been written by Umesh Shankar.  It is not yet ready for
  general use, and isn't compiled in unless -DACTIVE_MAPPING.

- Four new attributes can now be associated with tables (implemented
  by Robin Sommer): &read_expire, &write_expire, and &create_expire
  will delete table entries after a given interval has elapsed since
  the table entry was last read, written, or created.  For example:

	global a: table[addr] of count &default=0 &create_expire = 5 sec;

  will delete each entry added to it 5 seconds after the entry was added,
  regardless of subsequent read/write activity to the element.

  &expire_func allows you to associate a function with the table such that
  whenever an entry expires, the function is invoked.  It's passed the
  value of the table entry (not the index - perhaps this should be changed),
  and returns an "interval" value.  If the interval is <= 0.0 seconds, then
  the table entry is immediately deleted.  Otherwise, it is deleted after
  the given interval has elapsed.

- When listing multiple attributes, you no longer separate them with
  commas.  For example, if you used to have:

	global a: table[string] of count &default=0, &redef;

  you now need to use:

	global a: table[string] of count &default=0 &redef;

- You can now construct records using

	[$field1 = <expression>, $field2 = <expression>, ...]

  Such record values can be assigned to other records providing that the
  target value's type includes all of the fields (same name and type)
  present in the record value, and that any missing fields have the
  &optional or &default attribute (see next item).

  You can also include a record value inside the record constructor, and
  all of its fields will be included in the constructed record value.

- Record fields can now be annotated with &optional, to indicate
  that the field needn't be present, or &default, which indicates
  a default value to provide if the field is missing.

- You can query as to whether a record has a value for a given field
  using the new "?$" operator.  So for example:

	type my_rec: record {
		num: count &default = 0;
		msg: string;	# mandatory, since no &optional/&default
	};

	global r: my_rec;

	r = [$msg = "hello"];

	print r?$num, r?$msg, r$num;

  will print "F, T, 0," because even though 'r' has a default value
  for $num (which shows up when printing r$num), that field is missing,
  hence r?$num is F.

- An experimental scheme has been added (by Umesh Shankar) for managing
  general attributes associated either with all values ("global attributes")
  or particular particular values.  This scheme is likely to change in
  the near future, and hence isn't explained here further.

- The DNS analysis now includes ADDL and AUTH records, and much richer
  policy script analysis (per policy/dns.bro).

- You can now "redef" a function or event handler to override its
  previous definition.  For a function, this looks like:

	redef log_hook = function(msg: string): bool
		{
		...
		}

  For an event handler, it's just the usual definition preceded by "redef.
  For example,

	redef event ack_above_hole(c: connection) { }

  would replace the default ack_above_hole handler with one that does nothing.

- HTTP server and HTTP proxy backdoor detectors have been added,
  generating http_signature_found and http_proxy_signature_found,
  respectively (contributed by Ruoming Pang).

- A KaZaA backdoor detector has been added, which generates
  kazaa_signature_found for likely KaZaA connections.

- The new policy scripts flag-irc.bro and flag-warez.bro provide
  hooks for defining site policies for detecting IRC and access
  to warez.

- portmapper.bro now tracks the services it sees, and the names are
  used in connection summaries rather than generic services like port-656.

- bro -C (or redef'ing the "ignore_checksums" global to T) instructs
  Bro to ignore any checksum errors and go ahead and analyze such packets.

- The (trivial) policy script print-globals.bro dumps out all of the policy
  script global variables and the amount of memory they consume.

- The policy script code-red.bro has been renamed worm.bro and generalized
  to detect Nimda as well as Code Red 1 & 2.

- A bunch of additional default sensitive URIs have been added to http.bro.
  http.bro also now doesn't report worm-related URIs.

- A bunch of less common portnames were removed from port-names.bro.

- Empty regular expressions are now allowed.

- The finger_request event now has a third parameter, the additional
  text after the username.

- More systematic handling of NULs and CRLF by the event engine.

- Hex escape sequences now must have exactly two hexadecimal characters.

- FYI - work has begun on significantly altering the way that policy
  scripts generate alerts.

- Work has begun (by Robin Sommer) on a general framework for tracking
  client/server versions.  See software.bro.

- Work has begun on a NETBIOS analyzer (see NetbiosSSN.cc).  Contributions
  (e.g., finishing it :-) welcome.

- Work has begun on migrating the internals to process IPv6 in addition
  to IPv4.

- A number of bug fixes, leaks, and memory allocation lint tweaks.

v0.7a90 Thu Sep 06 00:50:43 PDT 2001

- Better state management, especially for use in high-volume sites.  There
  are now a number of ways to track the resources consumed by Bro while it
  runs, and to reduce the amount of memory Bro consumes.  Adding

	@load print-resources

  will log a summary of the resources consumed by Bro when it exits, and

	@load reduce-memory

  will change a number of default values in order to significantly diminish
  the amount of memory Bro requires.

  Other ways to lower the required memory discussed in the next three items.

- The global "maintain_http_sessions" now controls whether http.bro tracks
  multiple HTTP connections between the same hosts as a single HTTP session.
  Doing so costs a considerable amount of state (so set to F for reducing
  the memory impact of HTTP analysis).

- The global "suppress_scan_checks", if true, turns off address and port
  scan detection.  (You can't achieve this by simply not @load'ing scan.bro,
  because it's loaded by some of the default policy scripts.)  Turning it
  off can save a lot of memory.

- Note, the ident.bro is also expensive in terms of state-holding.

- New library functions:

	- resource_usage() returns a record detailing real time,
	  CPU time, memory, other getrusage info, and the current
	  and maximum number of TCP/UDP/ICMP connections, and
	  timers and fragments.

	- val_size() returns the size in bytes needed to represent
	  a given value (which can be a record, a table, or a
	  simple constant, for example).  It's not fully accurate
	  but is in the right ballpark.

	- global_sizes() return a table mapping every global
	  variable to its size (per val_size()).  Useful for
	  tracking which ones are growing large over time.

- You can now control a number of timers related to Bro's connection
  management.  Setting them to lower values generally decreases the
  amount of state Bro has to keep (see reduce-memory.bro), though
  this can also make it easier for an attacker to evade detection:

	tcp_SYN_timeout: interval
		Controls how long Bro waits after seeing the
		beginning of a connection (whether due to a SYN
		or not; the timer is misnamed) before checking
		whether it elicited any reply.

	tcp_session_timer: interval
		After a connection has closed, wait this long for
		further activity before checking whether to time
		out its state.

	tcp_connection_linger: interval
		When checking a closed connection for further
		activity, Bro should consider it inactive if there
		hasn't been any for this long.  It also complains
		if the connection is reused before this much time
		has elapsed.

	tcp_attempt_delay: interval
		Bro waits this long upon seeing an initial SYN
		before timing out the connection attempt.

	tcp_close_delay: interval
		Upon seeing a normal connection close, Bro flushes
		state after this much time.

	tcp_reset_delay: interval
		Upon seeing a RST, Bro flushes state after this
		much time.

	tcp_partial_close_delay: interval
		Bro generates a connection_partial_close event this
		much time after one half of a partial connection
		closes, assuming there has been no subsequent
		activity.

	non_analyzed_lifetime: interval
		If a connection belongs to an application that you
		aren't analyzing, Bro times it out after this
		interval.  If 0 secs (default), then it doesn't
		time it out.

	dns_session_timeout: interval
	ntp_session_timeout: interval
	rpc_timeout: interval
		Bro waits this long before timing out a DNS/NTP/RPC
		request.

	max_timer_expires: count
		The maximum number of timers to expire after
		processing each new packet.  The value trades off
		spreading out the timer expiration load with
		possibly having to hold state longer.  A value of 0
		means "process all expired timers with each new
		packet".

- Two new flags control other facets of Bro's connection management,
  and thus state-holding:

	partial_connection_ok: bool
		Whether Bro should analyze connections for which
		it doesn't see the beginning, only the middle.
		This can be very expensive to do in the face of
		stealth-scanning, which looks like a bunch of
		partial connections.

		Note, the HTTP analyzer has been modified to
		now always skip partial connections.  This should
		instead be user controllable.

	tcp_SYN_ack_ok: bool
		If true, Bro instantiates connection state when
		it sees a SYN ack but not the initial SYN (even
		if partial_connection_ok is false).  The intent
		behind this knob (which is not well tested) is
		to allow you to filter out initial SYNs and only
		react to SYN acks.  This keeps Bro from holding
		state during SYN scans and SYN flooding, except
		for when the destination responds.

- Some other miscellaneous thresholds that you can now modify from your
  policy script:

	heartbeat_interval: count
		How often to generate net_stats_update() events.
		This timer really isn't needed any more, since
		you can use "schedule" to achieve the same effect.

	tcp_storm_thresh: count
		If Bro sees this many FINs/RSTs in a row, it
		flags them as a "storm".

	tcp_storm_interarrival_thresh: interval
		The FINs/RSTs must come with this much time or less
		between them.

- The state management for line-oriented applications like HTTP requests
  has been improved.

- The HTTP analyzer now expands %hex sequences.  If anyone has a Unicode
  expander to contribute, that'd be terrific.

- The Code Red detection is more robust (fewer false positives).

- A new redefinable variable, skip_services, lists applications that should
  not be analyzed for purposes of detecting scans.  (Default:  ident)
  The point of having this (poorly named) hook is so that code-red.bro
  can add "http" to it, to avoid reporting the zillions of Code Red scans
  that a site can see.

- Bro now matches regular expressions using lazy DFA evaluation.  The upshot
  of this is (1) it no longer maintains .bro-RE-cache.v1, (2) it starts
  up fast regardless of whether you've added new regular expressions, (3)
  you can afford to add lots of regular expressions, and (4) it's actually
  a bit faster.

- The list of "hot_ids" has been expanded with a number of other common
  root-privileged accounts.

v0.7a61 Fri Apr 06 14:51:47 PDT 2001

- An NTP analyzer has been added.  See policy/ntp.bro for a corresponding
  policy file that detects the newly discovered NTP remote buffer overflow
  attack.

- example-attacks/ is a new directory that contains trace files of attacks.
  Currently, there are just two to play with:

	bro -r example-attacks/ftp-site-exec.trace mt

  will run on a trace of a "site exec" overflow attack, and

	bro -r example-attacks/ntp-attack.trace mt ntp

  will run on an example of the NTP overflow.

- The doc/ directory includes the postscript and HTML versions of the
  first draft of the Bro manual.

- A new policy file, icmp.bro, has preliminary (and only partially developed)
  policy for analyzing ICMP.

- The file libpcap.bufsize.patch includes the patch necessary on some systems
  to increase the maximum libpcap buffer size.

- You can now use anonymous functions in &default expressions, so for
  example you can do:

	global foo: table[count] of string = {
		[1] = "1st", [2] = "2nd", [3] = "3rd",
	} &default = function(n: count): string { return fmt("%dth", n); };

  and then referring to foo[5] will yield "5th".

- There's now a "for" statement to iterate over the indices of a table
  or the members of a set:

	for ( i in foo )

  for the above "foo" will iterate with i assigned to 1, 2, and 3; *but
  not in general in that order*.

- The function contains_string() has been removed, and now you can instead
  use an expression like

	"bar" in "foobar"

  which will yield T.

- The scan detection now has a mechanism for attempting to detect SYN flooding
  backscatter and flagging it as different from a stealth scan.

- New event handlers:

	new_connection_contents()
		like new_connection(), but reassembles the
		stream so you can use set_content_files() to
		write it to a file

	udp_session_done()
		invoked when a UDP session (which is defined on
		a per-protocol basis; currently only for NTP)
		finishes.

	ntp_message()
		invoked for each NTP message

- UDP processing now does accounting for detecting scans.

- UDP processing now tracks numbers of requests/replies for sessions that
  support that notion.  The connections are annotated by udp_session_done()
  with "[m,n]" for "m" requests and "n" replies, providing either m or n > 1.

- New variable accessible from policy:

	watchdog_interval
		how often the watchdog should check for whether
		Bro is making internal progress

- A bunch of functions no longer have a first argument of the current time;
  get it instead from network_time() if you need it:

	authentication_accepted
	authentication_rejected
	conn_weird
	conn_weird_addl
	flow_weird
	net_weird

- A bunch of functions now return bool rather than int values:

	set_contents_file
	set_login_state
	set_record_packets
	skip_further_processing

- The variable "hot_dests" has been renamed to "hot_dsts".

- 111/tcp is now identified as "portmap" rather than "rpc".

- Connections flagged as hot for some types of characteristics are now
  annotated with the reason associated with the decision.  (I think a lot
  more of this is needed.)

- Portmapper dumps are annotated with the results of the mapping.  This
  will be streamlined in the future.

v0.7a48 Wed Sep 13 14:37:30 PDT 2000

- Changes between this release and v0.6 missing :-(

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

v0.6 Wed Jul 21 17:02:50 PDT 1999

- Support for regular expressions added.  You specify lex-style regular
  expressions between '/'s, for example "/\/etc\/(passwd|shadow)/" has
  the type "pattern" and matches /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow (the slashes
  in the pattern need to be escaped or else they'd delimit the end of the
  pattern).  Pattern-matching is via the "in" operator, so for example:

	if ( filename in /\/etc\/(passwd|shadow)/ )
		sensitive_file_access(filename);

  or

	const sensitive_files = /\/etc\/(passwd|shadow)/;

	...

	if ( filename in sensitive_files )
		sensitive_file_access(filename);

  Presently the "in" operator requires that the entire left-hand side
  be matched by the pattern.  So, for example, if you want to find the
  string "eggdrop" anywhere inside the string "line", you would use

	if ( line in /.*eggdrop.*/ )

  If you leave off either of the .*'s, then eggdrop will only be matched
  at the beginning or end of the line.

  In the future, there will be mechanisms for specifying whether you
  want to match anywhere in a line, or anchored; accordingly, *the above
  syntax is subject to change*.

  Bro compiles regular expressions into DFAs for fast matching.  This can take
  quite a bit of time for complicated patterns.  Consequently, it maintains a
  cache of compiled regular expressions in $HOME/.bro-RE-cache-v1.  You can
  always safely remove this file; Bro will recreate/repopulate it as needed.
  It does not clean up unused entries from it, so if you change your patterns
  frequently, you will accumulated lots of old ones and should delete the
  file to garbage collect them.

- An rlogin analysis module has been added and the telnet analysis
  generalized to generic "login" analysis, with the following events:

	login_failure(c: connection, user: string, client_user: string,
			password: string, line: string)
		Generated on a failed attempt to log in.  client_user is
		the remote user name, if the login is via the rlogin
		protocol.
	login_success(c: connection, user: string, client_user: string,
					password: string, line: string)
		Generated on a successful attempt to log in.

	login_input_line(c: connection, line: string)
		Generated per line of input typed by the user.
	login_output_line(c: connection, line: string)
		Generated per line of output generated by the server.

	login_confused(c: connection, msg: string, line: string)
		Generated when a login dialog confuses the heuristic
		analyzer.  msg is a tag for the state mismatch that
		was unexpected, line is the corresponding dialog text.

	login_confused_text(c: connection, line: string)
		Once a connection is in the confused state, then this
		is generated for each subsequent line.

	login_terminal(c: connection, terminal: string)
		Generated if the terminal type associated with the
		connection is seen.

	login_display(c: connection, display: string)
		Generated if the display associated with the connection
		is seen.

	excessive_line(c: connection)
		Generated when the connection has produced an excessively
		long line.

  login_input_line() and login_output_line() are very powerful for
  detecting intrusions, when coupled with regular-expression matching.

  login_terminal() is used to detect backdoors that are triggered
  by the terminal environment variable.

- An ident analysis module has been added (port 113).  It generates
  ident_request, ident_reply, and ident_error events.  Port 113 used
  to be referred to as "auth"; now it's referred to as "ident".

- A new type of scan detection has been added, which is triggered
  by a remote host trying a large number of username/password
  combinations.  See the account_tried() function in scan.bro.

- The default search path for .bro files is now

	  .:priv-policy:policy:pub-policy:/usr/local/lib/bro

  where priv-policy/ is intended for private policy and pub-policy/
  for public policy.  The Bro alpha distribution ships with a
  sample set of pub-policy scripts.

- New built-ins:

	system(s: string): int
		executes the given shell command using system()
		and returns its status.

	set_contents_file(c: conn_id, direction: count, f: file)
		copies connection c's reassembled byte stream in
		either the originator-to-responder direction (if
		direction is CONTENTS_ORIG) or the responder-to-
		originator direction (CONTENTS_RESP) to the file f.

	reading_live_traffic(): bool
		returns true if Bro is running on live traffic (read
		from a network interface), false if it's reading from
		a save file.

	mkdir(f: string): bool
		creates the given directory, returning true if it
		was able to, false if not.

	get_orig_seq(c: conn_id): count;
		returns the highest sequence number sent by the
		originator of connection c.
	get_resp_seq(c: conn_id): count;
		same for c's responder.

- Additional new events (other than those related to the new analyzers):

	new_connection(c: connection)
		is generated whenever a new connection is seen.

	partial_connection(c: connection)
		is generated whenever a new partial connection (one
		that doesn't begin with a SYN handshake) is seen.

	pm_bad_port(r: connection, bad_p: count)
		is generated when a portmapper response contains
		a bad port number.

- Functions, tables and sets can now be assigned.  Assignment is
  made by reference to the underlying object.

- Bro no longer looks up identifiers using getservbyname() to see if they
  should be interpreted as port numbers, since this led to portability
  problems.  Instead, a number of constants are defined in bro.init:
  bgp, domain, finger, ftp, gopher, http, ident, rlogin, smtp, ssh and telnet,

- Bro now supports an arbitrary number of open files (not bound by
  the system's limit on file descriptors).

- There's now a finger_reply event to go with finger_request.

- A bunch more RPC service names have been added, thanks to Job de Haas
  and others.

- A bug has been fixed in the watchdog handling that caused it to
  sometimes expire after a period of network inactivity.

- The Bro paper in doc/ has been revised (it isn't quite up-to-date,
  but considerably closer than the USENIX version).

- There has been a large amount of reworking of the internals, both
  to Bro itself and in the policy scripts.  If you find something you're
  wondering about, feel free to send me mail asking about it.

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

v0.5 Sun Oct  4 00:19:35 PDT 1998

- Added Linux support.

- Major autoconf changes.

- Some tweaks to suppress g++ warnings.

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

v0.4 Fri Sep 11 00:08:04 PDT 1998

- The new aux/ directory has some utility programs and scripts.
  See aux/README for details.

- Documentation (though exceedingly limited) describing the connection
  log summaries generated by policy/tcp.bro now available in doc/conn-logs.

- The Telnet username recognition code has been heavily reworked and is
  now significantly more robust.

- A new policy file, policy/scan.bro, detects port and address scanning.

- Bro now detects the "Land" attack (a trivial addition to its spoof
  detection).

- The distribution now comes with BIND 8.1.2.

- A new flavor of "weird" event has been added, flow_weird, for unusual
  events associated with <src IP addr, dst IP addr> flows (i.e., a coarser
  granularity than TCP or UDP connections).

- Bro now reassembles fragments, checking for overlaps and consistency.
  Associated with fragments are the following flow_weird's:

	excessively_large_fragment
	excessively_small_fragment
	fragment_inconsistency
	fragment_overlap
	fragment_protocol_inconsistency
	fragment_size_inconsistency
	fragment_with_DF
	incompletely_captured_fragment

- The TCP stream reassembly code was rewritten to share functionality
  with the new fragment reassembly code.

- If a handler for it is present, then Bro will generate "packet_contents"
  events containing the contents of each packet it receives.  This is just
  for experimenting with, and, in particular, this event does *not* reflect
  TCP stream reassembly.

- The handling of "conn_weird" events in tcp.bro now has more options.
  In the weird_action table, WEIRD_LOG_ALWAYS means that the weird event
  should always be logged; WEIRD_LOG_PER_CONN means that it should be
  logged once per connection; and WEIRD_LOG_PER_ORIG that it should be
  launched once per originator IP address.

- The example hot.bro now includes provisions for flagging sensitive
  inbound and outbound services.

- Bro now limits the number of events processed when draining the event
  queue after processing a packet.  This makes Bro less prone to packet
  loss during high-speed scans.

- The line-oriented TCP endpoint class was split into TCP_EndpointLine,
  which supports the line-oriented functionality, and TCP_NVT (derived
  from TCP_EndpointLine), which implements the Network Virtual Terminal
  used by Telnet and FTP.

- The TCP_NVT class now understands the Telnet Environment option.

- Escape sequences are now '\' followed by 1 or more octal digits,
  instead of excatly three octal digits (which is error prone).

- If the watchdog timer expires, it now reports the number of events
  processed in the current batch of packets, as well as other timing
  information.

- Bro now should not report packet drops that occur after it has begun
  to exit (these can occur when draining the pending event queue takes
  a while).

- Bro now detects TCP acknowledgements that occur above a sequence
  hole, generating an ack_above_hole event.  Nominally, this indicates
  packet filter drops, but in fact some buggy TCPs manage to do this :-(.

- Fledgling HTTP support added.  An http_request event is generated when
  a new HTTP request is seen, and http_stats is generated when an HTTP
  connection terminates, giving (uninteresting to most people) statistics
  concerning the request(s).  A lot more is needed: parsing persistent
  connections and HTTP replies, for one.  This is just a start.  A stub
  for http_reply exists but these events are not presently generated.

- Ported to Linux (thanks to Pascal Bouchareine).

- A bug in to_lower() and to_upper() was fixed.

- The reporting for unexpected FTP connections now more directly
  identifies the corresponding FTP session.

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

v0.3 Fri Feb 13 19:59:39 PST 1998

- Timers are now implemented using calendar queues rather than priority
  queues (with thanks to Craig Leres).

- The new byte_len() built-in returns the length of a string interpreted
  as a set of bytes (including any NUL bytes, especially the final one
  for a typical string).

- The new sub_bytes() built-in extracts a subset of a string interpreted
  as a set of bytes (i.e., immune to any embedded NULs).

- Fixed bad interaction with the latest version of libpcap that on some
  BPF systems would cause Bro to exit any time a little bit of time went by
  without any traffic matching its filter.

- A bug with constant-folding of the ?: operator has been fixed.

- A new "conn_stats" event delivers statistical analysis (number of packets
  transmitted, retransmitted, out-of-order, replicated) of each connection.
  If you define a handler for it, then *no* other TCP processing is done.
  This was added for off-line analysis of traces with large numbers of
  connections in them.

- Some minor portability tweaks.

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

v0.2 Sat Oct 25 11:22:37 PDT 1997

- Added autoconf support, thanks to Scott Denton.

- Ported to FreeBSD, Solaris.

- Fixed a bug in which partial connections were ignored even for
  protocols (e.g., FTP) that can make use of partial dialogs.

- Included BIND version 8 sources directly in the distribution.

- Better usage() information (again thanks to Scott), -h and -v flags.

- README, CHANGES files created.
