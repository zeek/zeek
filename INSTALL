Installing Bro
==============

Prerequisites
=============

Bro relies on the following libraries and tools, which need to be installed
before you begin:

    * A C/C++ compiler

    * Libpcap headers and libraries
       Network traffic capture library

    * Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer)
       Flex is already installed on most systems, so with luck you can
       skip having to install it yourself.

    * Bison (GNU Parser Generator)
       This comes with many systems, but if you get errors compiling
       parse.y, you will need to install it.

    * Perl
       Used only during the Bro build process

    * sed
       Used only during the Bro build process

    * BIND8 headers and libraries
       These are usually already installed as well.

    * OpenSSL headers and libraries
        For analysis of SSL certificates by the HTTP analyzer, and
        for encrypted Bro-to-Bro communication. These are likely installed,
        though some platforms may require installation of a 'devel' package
         for the headers.

    * CMake 2.6 or greater
       CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system, typically
       not installed by default.  See http://www.cmake.org for more
       information regarding CMake and the installation steps below for
       how to use it to build this distribution.  CMake generates native
       Makefiles that depend on GNU Make by default.

Bro can also make uses of some optional libraries if they are found at
installation time:

    * Libmagic
      For identifying file types (e.g., in FTP transfers).

    * LibGeoIP
       For geo-locating IP addresses.

    * Libz
       For decompressing HTTP bodies by the HTTP analyzer, and for
       compressed Bro-to-Bro communication.

Installation
============

To build and install into /usr/local/bro:

    > ./configure
    > make
    > make install

This will perform an out-of-source build into a directory called
build/, using default build options. It then installs the Bro binary
into /usr/local/bro/bin. Depending on the Bro package you
downloaded, there may be auxiliary tools and libraries available in
the aux/ directory. If so, they will be installed by default as well
if not explicitly disabled via configure options and may also have
additional installation/configuration instructions that you can
find in their source directories.

You can specify a different installation directory with

    > ./configure --prefix=<dir>

Note that "/usr" and "/opt/bro" are standard prefixes for binary
packages to be installed, so those are typically not good choices
unless you are creating such a package.

Run "./configure --help" for more options.

Running Bro
===========

Bro is a complex program and it takes a bit of time to get familiar
with it. In the following we give a few simple examples.  See the
quickstart guide at http://www.bro-ids.org for more information; you
can the source that in doc/quick-start.

For developers that wish to run Bro from the the build/ directory
after performing "make", but without performing "make install", they
will have to first set BROPATH to look for scripts inside the build
directory.  Sourcing either build/bro-path-dev.sh or build/bro-path-dev.csh
as appropriate for the current shell accomplishes this. e.g.:

    > ./configure
    > make
    > source build/bro-path-dev.sh
    > ./build/src/bro
