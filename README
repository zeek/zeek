Zeek Network Security Monitor
=============================

Zeek is a powerful framework for network analysis and security
monitoring.

(Zeek is the new name for the long-established Bro system. Note that
parts of the system retain the "Bro" name, and it also often appears in
the documentation and distributions.)

Please see the INSTALL file for installation instructions and pointers
for getting started.  NEWS contains release notes for the current
version, and CHANGES has the complete history of changes.  Please see
COPYING for licensing information.
