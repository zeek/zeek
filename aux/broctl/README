BroControl
===========
Robin Sommer
:email: robin@icir.org

This document summarizes installation and use of _BroControl_,
Bro's interactive shell for operating Bro installations. _Bro
Control_ has two modes of operation: a _stand-alone_ mode for
managing a traditional, single-system Bro setup; and a _cluster_
mode for maintaining a multi-system setup of coordinated Bro
instances load-balancing the work across a set of independent
machines. Below, we describe the installation process separately for
the two modes. Once installed, the operation is pretty similar for
both types; just keep in mind that if this documents refers to
"nodes" and you're in a stand-alone setup, there's is only a single
one and no worker/proxies.)

Prerequisites
-------------

Running _BroControl_ requires the following prerequisites:

  - A Unix system. FreeBSD, Linux, and MacOS are supported and
  should work out of the box. Note however that FreeBSD usually sees
  more testing as it is Bro's primary development platform.  Other
  Unix systems will quite likely require some tweaking. Note that in
  a cluster setup, all systems must be running exactly the _same_
  operating system.

  - A version of _Python_ >= 2.4. 

  - A _bash_ (note in particular, that on FreeBSD, _bash_ is not
  installed by default). 

NOTE: If you're using a development version, you might need to apply
a patch to Bro. Please xref:devversion[see below].

Installing a Stand-alone Bro
----------------------------

This is the default installation. Configure and compile Bro as
usual, specifying the target installation path as ``prefix`` (we use
+/usr/local/bro+ as an example):

  > cd /path/to/bro/source/distribution
  > ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bro
  > make

- Install _BroControl_:

  > make install-broctl

  (This includes the standard "make install".)

- Add +<prefix>/bin+ to your +PATH+.

- The installation installs three configuration files which you
  should edit:

  * +etc/broctl.cfg+ is the overall _BroControl_ configuration.
  Initially, you probably only need to edit the email address for
  mails sent by the framework; that's the +MailTo+ line. 

  * In +etc/nodes.cfg+, you need to specify the network interface
  Bro is to monitor; that's the +interface+ line. 

  * In +etc/networks.cfg+, list all the networks which Bro should
  consider as local to the monitored enviroment. 

- Once you have updated these files, install the modified
  configuration:

  > broctl install

- Some tasks need to be run on a regular basis. Insert a line like
this into your crontab:

  0-59/5 * * * * /usr/local/bro/bin/broctl cron

- Finally, you can start Bro:

  > broctl start

Installing a Bro Cluster
------------------------

A _Bro Cluster_ is a set of systems jointly analyzing the traffic of
a network link in a coordinated fashion. _BroControl_ is able to
operate such a setup from a central manager system pretty much
transparently, hiding much of the complexity of the multi-machine
installation. 

A cluster consists of four types of components:

  1. One or more frontends.
       Frontends load-balance the traffic across a set of worker
       machines.

  2. Worker nodes.
       Workers are doing the actual analysis, with each seeing a
       slice of the overall traffic as splitted up by the frontends.

  3. One or more proxies.
       Proxies relay the communication between worker nodes.

  4. One manager.
       The manager provides the cluster's user-interface for
       controlling and logging. During operation, the user only
       interacts with the manager; this is where _BroControl_ is
       running.

See http:///www.icir.org/robin/papers/raid07.pdf[this RAID Paper]
for more information about the general cluster architecture. This
document focusses on the installation of manager, workers, and the
proxies. See <somewhere different> for a discussion of how to setup
a frontend. If not otherwise stated, in the following we use the
terms "manager", "worker", and "proxy" to refer to Bro instances,
not to physical machines; rather, we use the term "node" to refer to
physical machines. There may be multiple Bro instances running on
the same node. For example, it's possible to run a proxy on the same
node as the manager is operating on. 

In the following, as an example setup, we will assume that our
cluster consists of four nodes (not counting the frontend). The host
names of the systems will be +host1+, +host2+, +host3+, and +host4+.
We will configure the cluster so that +host1+ runs the manager and
the (only) proxy, and +host{2,3,4}+ are each running one worker.
This is a typical setup, which will work well for many sites.

When installing a cluster, in addition to the prerequisites
mentioned above, you need to

  - have the same user account set up on all nodes. On the worker
  nodes, this user must have access to target network interface in
  promiscious mode. +ssh+ access from the manager node to this user
  account must be setup on all machines, and must work without
  asking for a password/passphrase.

  - have some storage available on all nodes under the same path,
  which we will call the cluster's _prefix_ path. In the following,
  we will use +/usr/local/bro+ as an example. The Bro user must
  be able to either create this directory or, where it already
  exists, must have write permission inside this directory on all
  nodes.

  - have +ssh+ and +rdist+ installed. 

With all prerequisites in place, as the Bro user, perform the
following steps to install a Bro cluster:

- Configure and compile the Bro distribution using the cluster's
  prefix path as +--prefix+ +--prefix+, and selecting cluster
  operation with the +--enable-cluster+ option:

  > cd /path/to/bro/source/distribution
  > ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/bro --enable-cluster
  > make

- Install _BroControl_:

  > make install-broctl

  (This includes the standard +make install+.)

- Add +<prefix>/bin+ to your +PATH+.

- Create a cluster configuration file. There is an example provided,
which you can edit according to the instructions in the file:

  > cd /usr/local/bro
  > cp etc/broctl.cfg.example etc/broctl.cfg
  > vi etc/broctl.cfg

- Create a node configuration file to define where manager, workers,
  and proxies are to run. There is again an example, which defines
  the example scenario described above and can be edited as needed:

  > cd /usr/local/bro
  > cp etc/node.cfg.example etc/node.cfg
  > vi etc/node.cfg

- Create a network configuration file that lists all of the networks
  which the cluster should consider as local to the monitored
  enviroment. Once, again the installation installs a template for
  editing:

  > cd /usr/local/bro
  > cp etc/networks.cfg.example etc/networks.cfg
  > vi etc/networks.cfg

- Install workers and proxies using _BroControl_:

  > broctl install
+ 
This installation process uses +ssh+ and +rdist+ to copy the
configuration over to the remote machines so, as described above,
you need to ensure that logging in via SSH works before the install will
succeed. 

- Some tasks need to be run on a regular basis. On the manager node,
insert a line like this into the crontab of the user running the
cluster.

  0-59/5 * * * * <prefix>/bin/broctl cron

- Finally, you can start the cluster:

  > broctl start

Getting Started
---------------

_BroControl_ is an interactive interface to the cluster which
allows you to, e.g., start/stop the monitoring or update its
configuration. It is started with the +broctl+ script and then
expects commands on its command-line (alternatively, +broctl+ can
also be started with a single command directly on the shell's
command line):

  > cluster
  Welcome to BroControl 0.2

  Type "help" for help.

  [BroControl] >

As the message says, type xref:cmd_help[+help+] to see a list of all
commands. We will now briefly summarize the most important commands.
A full reference follows link:cmd_reference[below]. 

Once +broctl.cfg+ and +node.cfg+ are set up as described above, the
monitoring can be started with the xref:cmd_start[+start+] command.
In the cluster setup, this will successively start manager, proxies,
and workers. The xref:cmd_status[+status+] command should then show
all nodes as operating. To stop the monitoring, issue the
xref:cmd_stop[+stop+] command. xref:cmd_exit[+exit+] leaves the
shell. 

On the manager system (and on the standalone system), you find the
current set of (aggregated) logs in +logs/current+ (which is a
symlink to the corresponding spool directory.) The workers and
proxies log into +spool/proxy/+ and +spool/<worker-name>/+,
respectively. The manager/stand-alone logs are archived in +logs/+,
by default once a day. Logs files of workers and proxies are
discarded at the same rotation interval.

Whenenver the _BroControl_ configuration is modified in any way
(including changes to configuration files and site-specific policy
scripts), xref:cmd_install[+install+] installs the new version. _No
changes will take effect until xref:cmd_install[+install+] is run_.
Before you run xref:cmd_install[+install+], xref:cmd_check[+check+]
can be used to check for any potential erros in the new
configuration, e.g., typos in scripts. If xref:cmd_check[+check+]
does not report any problems, doing xref:cmd_install[+install+] will
pretty likely not break anything. 

Note that generally configuration changes only take effect after a
restart of the affected nodes. The xref:cmd_restart[+restart+]
command triggers this. Some changes however can be put into effect
on-the-fly without restarting any of the nodes by using the
xref:cmd_update[+update+] command (again only after doing
xref:cmd_install[+install+] first). Such dynamic updates work with
all changes done via the xref:cmd_analysis[+analysis+] command (see
below) as well as generally with all policy which only modify global
variables declared as _redefinable_ (i.e., with Bro's _&redef_
attribute).

Generally, site-specific tuning needs to be done with local policy
scripts, as in any Bro setup. This is described
link:site_tuning[below]. Some general types of analysis can however
be enabled/disabled via the xref:cmd_analysis[+analysis+] command.

_BroControl_ provides various options to control the behaviour of the
setup. These options can be set by editing +etc/broctl.cfg+. The
xref:cmd_config[+config+] command gives list of all options with
their current values. A list of the most important options also
follows link:cmd_reference[below].

Site-specific Customization
---------------------------
[[site_tuning]]

You'll most likely want to adapt the Bro policy to the local
environment. While some types of analysis can be customized via the
xref:cmd_analysis[+analysis+] command, much of the more specific
tuning requires writing local policy files. 

By default, it is assumed that you put site-specific policy scripts
into the +share/bro/site+ directory. To change the location of site
policies, set the option xref:opt_SitePolicyPath[+SitePolicyPath+]
in +broctl.cfg+ to a different path.

During the initial install, sample policy scripts are installed in
+share/bro/site+, which you can edit as appropiate. In the stand-alone
setup, this is just a single file called +local.bro+. In the cluster
setup, there are three: +local-manager.bro+ and +local-worker.bro+
are loaded by the manager and the workers (plus proxies),
respectively. In turn, both of these load +local.bro+, which
contains all configuration code shared by all nodes. If in doubt,
put your customizations into +local.bro+ so that all nodes see it.
If you want to change which local scripts are loaded by the nodes,
you can set xref:opt_SitePolicyManager[+SitePolicyManager+] for the
manager and xref:opt_SitePolicyWorker[+SitePolicyWorker+] for the
workers.

In the cluster setup, the main exception to putting everything into
+local.bro+ is notice filtering, which should be done only on the
manager. The example +local-manager.bro+ comes with an example setup
to configure notice policy and notice actions. You should to adapt
thiese to the local environment.

In general, all of _BroControl_'s policy scripts are loaded before any
site-specific policy so that you can redefine any of the defaults
locally. The xref:cmd_scripts[+scripts+] shows precisely which
policy scripts get loaded by a node; that can be very helpful for
debugging. 

Please note that enabling a particular kind of analysis via the
xref:cmd_analysis[+analysis+] command only has an effect if the
corresponding Bro scripts are loaded by the local site policy in
+local.bro+. 

It is also possible to add additional scripts to individual nodes
only. This works by setting the option +aux_scripts+ for the
corresponding node(s) in +etc/nodes.cfg+. For example, one could add
a script +experimental.bro+ to a single worker for trying out new
experimental code.

Command Reference
-----------------
[[cmd_reference]]

The following summary lists all commands supported by _BroControl_. All
commands may be either entered interactively or specificed on the
shell's command line. If not specified otherwise, commands taking
_[<nodes>]_ as arguments apply their action either to the given set
of nodes, or to all nodes if none is given.

include::README.cmds[]

Option Reference
----------------

This section summarizes the options that can be set in 
+etc/broctl.cfg+ for customizing the behaviour of _BroControl_. Usually,
one only needs to change the "user options", which are listed first.
The "internal options" are, as the name suggests, primarily used
internally and set automatically. They are documented here only for
reference.

include::README.options[]

Miscellanous
------------

Mails
~~~~~

_BroControl_ sents four types of mails to the address given in +MailTo+:

1. When logs are rotated (per default once a day), a list of all
   alerts during the last rotation interval is sent. This can be
   disabled by setting +MailAlarms=0+.

2. When the +cron+ command noticies that a node has crashed, it
   restarts it and sends a notification. It may also send a more
   detailed crash report containing information about the crash. 

3. NOTICES with a notice action of +NOTICE_EMAIL+; see the Bro
   documentation for how to configure NOTICE priorities. 

4. If link:trace_summary[+trace-summary+] is installed, a
   traffic summary is sent each rotation interval. 

Performance Analysis 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_TODO_: +broctl cron+ logs a number of statistics, which can be
analyzed/plotted for understanding the cluster's run-time behaviour.


Questions and Answers
---------------------

Can I use an NFS-mounted partition as the cluster's base directory to avoid the +rsync+'ing???  
    Yes. xref:opt_BroBase[+BroBase+] can be on an NFS partition.
    Configure and install the shell as usual with
    +--prefix=<BroBase>+. Then add xref:opt_HaveNFS[HaveNFS]=1+ and
    +SpoolDir=<spath>+ to +etc/broctl.cfg+, where +<spath>+ is a
    path on the local disks of the nodes; +<spath>+ will be used for
    all non-shared data (make sure that the parent directory exists
    and is writable on all nodes!). Then run xref:cmd_install[+make
    install-broctl+] again. Finally, you can remove
    +<BroBase>/spool+ (or link it to <spath>). In addition, you
    might want to keep the log files locally on the nodes as well by
    setting xref:opt_LogDir[+LogDir+]+ to a non-NFS directory. (Only
    the manager's logs will be kept permanently, the logs of
    workers/proxies are discarded upon rotation.)

When I'm using the xref:Standalone[standalone mode], do I still need to have +ssh+ and +rsync+ installed and configured???
    No. The standalone performs all operations directly on the local
    file system.

What do I need to do when the something in the Bro distribution changes???
    Just re-run +make broctl-install+. It will reinstall
    all the files from the distribution, except for any of the
    template files, as they might have been edited. 
+
In addition, _BroControl_ has a "development mode", which makes
installation easier if distribution files change frequently
(e.g., becayse you're working from SVN). Development mode
activated by adding +DevMode=1+ to +etc/broctl.cfg+. Once done,
_BroControl_'s +install+ command will also install all the files
from the distribution, just as +make broctl-install+ does. Note
that you obviously need to keep the distribution around to have
this work. 
+
Note for folks who have used the old "cluster shell": the
development mode corresponds to the old default behaviour, which
worked with any +make install-broctl+.

After a Bro crash, the timestamps of the archived log files sometimes seem to be wrong???
   When Bro crashes, broctl archives the log files produced so far
   at the normal location. However, for some files it can't (easily)
   determine the right timestamps to put into the filename. This
   affects in particular those log files that are not rotated on
   regular basis (e.g., +stdout.log+, +prof.log+); their filenames
   will indicate as their start time the point when all the other
   files were _rotated_ most recently. In addition, for all log
   files, after a crash the start/end times indicated by the file
   names might be off a few seconds. 

[[devversion]]Anything special to consider when using development versions???
   If you are using a _development version_, _BroControl_ might
   require patching Bro itself to work correctly. A "development
   version" is defined as anything you have downloaded from Bro's
   Subversion repository (as opposed to downloading a release
   tar-ball). If so, see if there's a file called
   +aux/broctl/patch-bro.diff+. If there is, apply it as follows
   before you proceed with any of the steps below:
+
   > cd /path/to/bro/source/distribution
   > patch -p0 <aux/broctl/patch-bro.diff
   > ./autogen.sh
