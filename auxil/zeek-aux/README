=======================
Zeek Auxiliary Programs
=======================

.. contents::

:Version: |version|

Handy auxiliary programs related to the use of the Zeek Network Security
Monitor (https://www.zeek.org).

Installation
============

Installation is simple and standard::

    ./configure
    make
    make install

adtrace
=======

The "adtrace" utility is used to compute the
network address that compose the internal and extern nets that Zeek
is monitoring. This program just reads a pcap
(tcpdump) file and writes out the src MAC, dst MAC, src IP, dst
IP for each packet seen in the file.

zeek-archiver
=============

This is a modern replacement for Zeek's historical log-archival process. For
details, please refer to its dedicated README in the zeek-archiver subdirectory.

zeek-cut
========

The "zeek-cut" utility reads ASCII Zeek logs on standard input
and outputs them to standard output with only the specified columns (the
column names can be found in each log file in the "#fields" header line).
If no column names are specified, then "zeek-cut" simply outputs all columns.

There are several command-line options available to modify the output (run
"zeek-cut -h" to see a list of all options).  There are options to convert
timestamps into human-readable format, and options to specify whether or not
to include the format header lines in the output (by default, they're not
included).

For example, the following command will output the three specified columns
from conn.log with the timestamps from the "ts" column being converted to
human-readable format::

    cat conn.log | zeek-cut -d ts id.orig_h id.orig_p

The specified order of the column names determines the output order of the
columns (i.e., "zeek-cut" can reorder the columns).

The "zeek-cut" utility can read the concatenation of one or more uncompressed
ASCII log files (however, JSON format is not supported) produced by Zeek
version 2.0 or newer, as long as each log file contains format header
lines (these are the lines at the beginning of the file starting with "#").
In fact, "zeek-cut" can process the concatenation of multiple ASCII log files
that have different column layouts.

To read a compressed log file, a tool such as "zcat" must be used to
uncompress the file.  For example, "zeek-cut" can read a group of compressed
conn.log files with a command like this::

    zcat conn.*.log.gz | zeek-cut


devel-tools
===========

A set of scripts used commonly for Zeek development. Note that none of
these scripts are installed by 'make install'.

extract-conn-by-uid
    Extracts a connection from a trace file based
    on its UID found in Zeek's conn.log

gen-mozilla-ca-list.rb
    Generates list of Mozilla SSL root certificates in
    a format readable by Zeek.

update-changes
    A script to maintain the CHANGES and VERSION files.

git-show-fastpath
    Show commits to the fastpath branch not yet merged into master.

cpu-bench-with-trace
    Run a number of Zeek benchmarks on a trace file.


rst
===

The "rst" utility can be invoked by a Zeek script to terminate an
established TCP connection by forging RST tear-down packets.
