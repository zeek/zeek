Usage: $0 -z [zeek binary path] -d [data file path]

  Options:
    -b, --build PATH        The path to a Zeek binary to benchmark
    -d, --data-file PATH    The path to a data file to read from for replay
    -m, --mode MODE         This can be one of three possible values:
                            intf, read, or flamegraph. This controls what
                            mode is used for the benchmark run, and defaults
                            to intf if not passed. The modes are described
                            below.
    -i, --interface INTF    The network interface to use for capturing data.
                            This interface should be completely idle, since
                            tcpreplay will be using it to replay the data.
                            This argument is ignored if the mode is 'file'.
    -f, --flamegraph PATH   The path to the directory where Flamegraph is
                            installed. This argument is required if the mode
                            is 'flamegraph', but is ignored otherwise.
    -o, --output FILE       The file prefix to use as output for Flamegraph.
                            This defaults to 'benchmark'. This argument is ignored
                            if the mode is not 'flamegraph'.
    -s, --seed FILE         (optional) A path to a Zeek random seed file.
                            This is used control the generation of connection
                            IDs and other data so it is consistent between
                            benchmarking runs.

    By default or when 'intf' is passed for the mode argument, the output will
    include CPU, memory, etc statistics from Zeek processing all of the data
    in the data file as if it was reading it live from the network. This mode
    requires an interface to be passed using the -i argument.

    When 'file' is passed for the mode (-m) argument, the output will include
    the runtime and maximum memory usage of Zeek when reading the data file
    directly from disk.

    When 'flamegraph' is passed for the mode (-m) argument, this script will
    output two flamegraphs for the process runtime in svg format. The first
    flamegraph is a standard graph showing the time spent in functions,
    stacked in the normal manner. The second graph is 'stack-reversed'.

    Symbols in Flamegraph outputs may not correctly stack unless the various
    libraries linked into Zeek are built with frame pointers. This includes
    glibc, libpcap, and openssl. Rebuilding those libraries with the
    -fno-omit-frame-pointer compiler flag may provide more accurate output.
    You can set libraries that get preloaded by setting the PRELOAD_LIBS
    variable in the script.

    This script assumes that it is being run on a system with a large number
    of CPU cores. If being used on a smaller system, modify this script and
    set the ZEEK_CPU and TCPREPLAY_CPU variables to smaller values.
