# This is loaded automatically at Zeek startup once the plugin gets activated
# and its BiF elements have become available. Include code here that should
# always execute unconditionally at that time. 
# 
# Note that often you may want your plugin's accompanying scripts not here, but
# in scripts/<plugin-namespace>/<plugin-name>/__load__.zeek. That's processed
# only on explicit `@load <plugin-namespace>/<plugin-name>`.
