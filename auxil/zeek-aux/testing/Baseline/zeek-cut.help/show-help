zeek-cut [options] [<columns>]

Extracts the given columns from ASCII Zeek logs on standard input, and outputs
them to standard output. If no columns are given, all are selected.
By default, zeek-cut does not include format header blocks in the output.

Example: cat conn.log | zeek-cut -d ts id.orig_h id.orig_p

    -c       Include the first format header block in the output.
    -C       Include all format header blocks in the output.
    -m       Include the first format header blocks in the output in minimal view.
    -M       Include all format header blocks in the output in minimal view.
    -d       Convert time values into human-readable format.
    -D <fmt> Like -d, but specify format for time (see strftime(3) for syntax).
    -F <ofs> Sets a different output field separator character.
    -h       Show help.
    -n       Print all fields *except* those specified.
    -u       Like -d, but print timestamps in UTC instead of local time.
    -U <fmt> Like -D, but print timestamps in UTC instead of local time.

For time conversion option -d or -u, the format string can be specified by
setting an environment variable ZEEK_CUT_TIMEFMT.
