.SH NAME
zeek-cut \- parse Zeek logs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zeek\-cut
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIcolumns\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Extracts the given columns from ASCII Zeek logs on standard input, and outputs
them to standard output.  If no field names are given, all are selected. By
default,
.B zeek\-cut
does not include format header blocks in the output.
.PP
Columns are specified as a list of space-separated field names.  The order of
field names given to \fBzeek-cut\fR determines the output order,
which means \fBzeek-cut\fR can be used to reorder columns.
.PP
The ASCII Zeek logs read on standard input must have intact format header
blocks because \fBzeek-cut\fR needs this information to correctly interpret the
log file format.  In fact, \fBzeek-cut\fR can process the concatenation of
multiple ASCII log files that have different column layouts.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
Include the first format header block in the output.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR
Include all format header blocks in the output.
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Include the first format header block in the output in minimal view.
.TP
\fB-M\fR
Include all format header blocks in the output in minimal view.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Convert time values into human\-readable format.
.HP
\fB\-D\fR <fmt> Like \fB\-d\fR, but specify format for time (see strftime(3) for syntax).
.HP
\fB\-F\fR <ofs> Sets a different output field separator character.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Show help.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Print all fields except those specified.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
Like \fB\-d\fR, but print timestamps in UTC instead of local time.
.HP
\fB\-U\fR <fmt> Like \fB\-D\fR, but print timestamps in UTC instead of local time.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B ZEEK_CUT_TIMEFMT
For time conversion option \fB\-d\fR or \fB\-u\fR, the format string can be
specified by setting this environment variable.
.SH EXAMPLES
Output three columns and convert time values:
.br
cat conn.log | zeek-cut -d ts id.orig_h id.orig_p
.PP
Output all columns and convert time values with a custom format string:
.br
cat conn.log | zeek-cut -D "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
.PP
Compressed logs must be uncompressed with another utility:
.br
zcat conn.log.gz | zeek-cut
