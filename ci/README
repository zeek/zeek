Continuous Integration Configuration Info

The following pointers are aimed at maintainers to help describe a few points
about the Cirrus CI setup that may not be obvious/intuitive.

Private Test Suite
------------------

Access to the private test suite is available in CI tasks except in Pull
Requests from people that do not otherwise have write access to the zeek
repository on GitHub.  To configure this access for the
``zeek-testing-private`` repository, it uses a "deploy key" which is a single
purpose SSH key with read-only permissions.  Here's how it can be set up:

1. ``ssh-keygen -f cirrus-key``

2. Add contents of ``cirrus-key.pub`` as a new key on GitHub:
   https://github.com/zeek/zeek-testing-private/settings/keys

3. Generate a new Cirrus CI secured variable in the repository settings at
   https://cirrus-ci.com/github/zeek/zeek.  The value of the secured variable
   is the base64-encoded private key, and can be obtained from the output of
   the command: ``base64 cirrus-key``.

4. Take the ``ENCRYPTED[...]``` string generated by Cirrus and use that as the
   value of ``ZEEK_TESTING_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY`` in ``.cirrus.yml``

5. Delete the local key: ``rm cirrus-key*``

6. Commit/push the changes.
