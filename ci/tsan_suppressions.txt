# This is a list of suppressions for ThreadSanitizer. Anything listed here will be
# ignored during testing. See https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerSuppressions
# for documentation on how this file works.

# There's a bug in libstdc++ that causes ThreadSanitizer to flag this as a data race.
# See https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=77704. Ignore any reports from this
# as it's really really noisy, and there's not much we can do to fix it.

# =====================================================================
# Everything below here are known failures in Zeek. These are here until they
# can be fixed, just so we can get the ThreadSanitizer builds running on Cirrus
# and catch anything new. If we can't fix something in this list (possibly the
# sqlite ones?) split them out into a separate block above here with a comment
# as to why.
