Developer Guides
================

In addition to documentation found or mentioned below, some developer-oriented
content is maintained directly in the `Zeek wiki
<https://github.com/zeek/zeek/wiki#development-guides>`_ due to the nature of
the content (e.g. the author finds it to be more dynamic, informal, meta,
transient, etc. compared to other documentation).

For more information about the documentation itself, see the ``doc`` directory
within the Zeek source tree `here <doc_repo_>`_.
