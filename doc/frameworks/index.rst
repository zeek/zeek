Frameworks
==========

Zeek includes several software frameworks that provide commonly used
functionality to the scripting layer. Among other things, these frameworks
enhance Zeek’s ability to ingest data, structure and filter its outputs, adapt
settings at runtime, and interact with other components in your network. Most
frameworks include functionality implemented in Zeek’s core, with
corresponding data structures and APIs exposed to the script layer.

Some frameworks target relatively specific use cases, while others run in
nearly every Zeek installation. The logging framework, for example, provides
the machinery behind all of the Zeek logs covered earlier. Frameworks also
build on each other, so it’s well worth knowing their capabilities. The next
sections cover them in detail.
