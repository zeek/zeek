Management Framework
====================

.. rst-class:: opening

   The management framework provides a Zeek-based, service-oriented architecture
   and event-driven APIs to manage a Zeek cluster that monitors live traffic. It
   provides a central, stateful *controller* that relays and orchestrates
   cluster management tasks across connected *agents*. Each agent manages Zeek
   processes in its local *instance*, the Zeek process tree controlled by the
   local Zeek :ref:`Supervisor <framework-supervisor>`. A management *client*
   lets the user interact with the controller to initiate cluster management
   tasks, such as deployment of cluster configurations, monitoring of
   operational aspects, or to restart cluster nodes. The default client is
   ``zeek-client``, included in the Zeek distribution.

.. _framework-management-quickstart:

Quickstart
==========

Run the following (as root) to launch an all-in-one management instance on your
system:

.. code-block:: console

   # zeek -C -j policy/frameworks/management/controller policy/frameworks/management/agent

The above will stay in the foreground. In a new shell, save the following
content to a file ``cluster.cfg`` and adapt the workers' sniffing interfaces to
your system:

.. literalinclude:: management/mini-config.ini
   :language: ini

Run the following command (as any user) to deploy the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: management/mini-deployment.console
   :language: console

You are now running a Zeek cluster on your system. Try ``zeek-client get-nodes``
to see more details about the cluster's current status. (In the above, "testbox"
is the system's hostname.)

Architecture and Terminology
============================

Controller
----------

The controller forms the central hub of cluster management. It exists once in
every installation and runs as a Zeek process solely dedicated to management
tasks. It awaits instructions from a management client and communicates with one
or more agents to manage their cluster nodes.

All controller communication happens via :ref:`Broker <broker-framework>`-based
Zeek event exchange, usually in the form of request-response event pairs tagged
with a request ID to provide context. The controller is stateful and persists
cluster configurations to disk. In a multi-system setup, the controller runs
inside a separate, dedicated Zeek instance. In a single-system setup, the
controller can run as an additional process in the local instance.

The controller's API resides in the :zeek:see:`Management::Controller::API` module.
Additional code documentation is :doc:`here </scripts/policy/frameworks/management/controller/index>`.

Instance
--------

A Zeek instance comprises the set of processes managed by a Zeek
:ref:`Supervisor <framework-supervisor>`. The management framework builds
heavily on the Supervisor framework and cannot run without it. Typically, a
single instance includes all Zeek processes on the local system (a physical
machine, a container, etc), but running multiple instances on a system is
possible.

Agent
-----

Management agents implement instance-level cluster management tasks. Every
instance participating in cluster management runs an agent. Agents peer with the
controller to receive instructions (a node restart, say), carry them out, and
respond with the outcome. The direction of connection establishment for the
peering depends on configuration and can go either way (more on this below); by
default, agents connect to the controller.

The agent's API resides in the :zeek:see:`Management::Agent::API` module.
Additional code documentation is :doc:`here </scripts/policy/frameworks/management/agent/index>`.

Agents add script-layer code to both the Supervisor (details :doc:`here
</scripts/policy/frameworks/management/supervisor/index>`) and Zeek cluster
nodes (details :doc:`here </scripts/policy/frameworks/management/node/index>`)
to enable management tasks (e.g. to tap into node stdout/stderr output) and to
receive confirmation of successful node startup.

Cluster nodes
-------------

The Zeek processes involved in traffic analysis and log output make up the Zeek
*cluster*, via the :ref:`cluster framework <cluster-framework>`. The management
framework does not change the cluster framework, and all of its concepts (the
manager, logger(s), workers, etc) apply as before. Cluster *nodes* refer to
individual Zeek processes in the cluster, as managed by the Supervisor.

Client
------

The management client provides the user's interface to cluster management. It
allows configuration and deployment of the Zeek cluster, insight into the
running cluster, the ability to restart nodes, etc. The client uses the
controller's event API to communicate and is the only component in the framework
not (necessarily) implemented in Zeek's script layer. The Zeek distribution
ships with ``zeek-client``, a command-line client implemented in Python, to
provide management functionality. Users are welcome to implement other clients.

.. _framework-management-visual-example:

A Visual Example
================

Consider the following setup, consisting of a single instance, controller, and a
connected ``zeek-client``, all running on different machines:

.. image:: /images/management.png
   :align: center

The cluster system runs a single management instance, with an agent listening on
TCP port 2151, the default. Since the agent needs to communicate with the
Supervisor for node management tasks and the two run in separate processes, the
Supervisor listens for Broker peerings, on TCP port 9999 (again, the default),
and the two communicate events over topic ``zeek/supervisor``. As shown, the
agent has launched a 4-node Zeek cluster consisting of two workers, a logger,
and a manager, communicating internally as usual.

The controller system is more straightforward, consisting merely of a
Supervisor-governed management controller. This controller has connected to and
peered with the agent on the cluster system, to relay commands received by the
client via the agent's API and receive responses over Broker topic
``zeek/management/agent``. Since the controller doesn't need to interact with
the Supervisor, the latter doesn't listen on any ports. Standalone controllers,
as running here, still require a Supervisor, to simplify co-located deployment
of agent and controller in a single instance.

Finally, the admin system doesn't run Zeek, but has it installed to provide
``zeek-client``, the CLI for issuing cluster management requests. This client
connects to and peers with the controller, exchanging controller API events over
topic ``zeek/management/controller``. For more details on ``zeek-client``, see
:ref:`below <framework-management-zeek-client>`.

In practice you can simplify the deployment by running ``zeek-client`` directly
on the controller machine, or by running agent and controller jointly on a
single system. We cover this in :ref:`more detail
<framework-management-running>`.

Goals and Relationship to ZeekControl
=====================================

The management framework first shipped in usable form in Zeek 5.0. It will
replace the aging :ref:`ZeekControl <cluster-configuration>` over the course of
the coming releases. The framework is not compatible with ZeekControl's approach
to cluster management: use one or the other, not both.

The framework currently targets single-instance deployments, i.e., setups in
which traffic monitoring happens on a single system. While the management
framework technically supports clusters spanning multiple monitoring systems,
much of the infrastructure users know from ``zeekctl`` (such as the ability to
deploy Zeek scripts and additional configuration) is not yet available in the
management framework.

ZeekControl remains included in the Zeek distribution, and remains the
recommended solution for multi-system clusters and those needing rich management
capabilities.

.. _framework-management-running:

Running Controller and Agent
============================

.. _joint-launch:

Joint launch
------------

The easiest approach is to run a single Zeek instance in which the Supervisor
launches both an agent and the controller. The framework comes pre-configured for
this use-case. Its invocation looks as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   # zeek -j policy/frameworks/management/controller policy/frameworks/management/agent

The ``-j`` flag enables the Supervisor and is required for successful launch of
the framework. (Without it, the above command will simply return.)

.. note::

   If you're planning to monitor the machine's own traffic, add the ``-C`` flag
   to avoid checksum errors, which commonly happen in local monitoring due to
   offload of the checksum computation to the NIC.

The following illustrates this setup:

.. image:: /images/management-all-in-one.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 75%

Separate controller and agent instances
---------------------------------------

You can also separate the agent and controller instances. For this, you'd say

.. code-block:: console

   # zeek -j policy/frameworks/management/agent

for the agent, and

.. code-block:: console

   # zeek -j policy/frameworks/management/controller

for the controller. You can run the latter as a regular user, assuming the user
has write access to the installation's spool and log directories (more on this
below). While technically not required to operate a stand-alone controller, the
Supervisor is currently also required in this scenario, so don't omit the
``-j``.

This looks as follows:

.. image:: /images/management-all-in-one-two-zeeks.png
   :align: center


Controller and agent instances on separate systems
--------------------------------------------------

You can also separate the two across different systems, though that approach
will only really start to make sense when the framework fully supports running
multiple traffic-sniffing instances. To do this, you either need to configure
the agent to find the controller, or tell the controller where to find the
agent. For the former, redefine the corresponding config setting, for example by
saying

.. code-block:: zeek

   redef Management::Agent::controller = [$address="1.2.3.4", $bound_port=21500/tcp];

in ``local.zeek`` and then launching

.. code-block:: console

   # zeek -j policy/frameworks/management/agent local

The result looks as already covered :ref:`earlier <framework-management-visual-example>`:

.. image:: /images/management.png
   :align: center

To make the controller connect to remote agents, deploy configurations that
include the location of such agents in the configuration. More on this below.

Multiple instances
------------------

You can run multiple instances on a single system, but it requires some
care. Doing so requires specifying a different listening port for each agent,
and additionally providing a different listening port for each instance's
Supervisor. Since agents communicate with their Supervisor to facilitate node
management, the Supervisor needs to listen (though only locally).  Furthermore,
you need to ensure this agent runs with a unique name (see the next section for
more on naming).

Assuming you already have an instance running, a launch of an additional agent
might look as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   # zeek -j policy/frameworks/management/agent \
     Management::Agent::default_port=2152/tcp \
     Management::Agent::name=agent-standby \
     Broker::default_port=10001/tcp

Finally, as already mentioned, you can spread multiple instances across multiple
systems to explore distributed cluster management. This simplifies the
individual launch invocations, but for practical distributed cluster use you may
find the framework's current cluster management features lacking when compared
to ZeekControl.

Controller and agent naming
---------------------------

The management framework identifies all nodes in the system by name, and all
nodes (agent(s), controller, and Zeek cluster nodes) must have unique names. By
default, the framework chooses ``agent-<hostname>`` and
``controller-<hostname>`` for agent and controller, respectively. To reconfigure
naming, set the ``ZEEK_AGENT_NAME`` / ``ZEEK_CONTROLLER_NAME`` environment
variables, or redefine the following:

.. code-block:: zeek

   redef Management::Controller::name = "controller1";
   redef Management::Agent::name = "agent1";

Firewalling and encryption
--------------------------

By default, the controller listens for clients and agents on ports ``2149/tcp`` and
``2150/tcp``. The former port supports Broker's WebSocket data format, the latter its
traditional one.
Unless you run all components, including the client, on a single system, you'll
want to open up these ports on the controller's system. The agent's default port
is ``2151/tcp``. It always listens; this allows cluster nodes to connect to it
to send status reports. If the agents connect to the controller, your firewall
may block the agent's port since host-local connectivity from cluster nodes to
the agent process suffices.

To switch agent and/or controller to different ports, set environment variables
``ZEEK_CONTROLLER_PORT`` / ``ZEEK_CONTROLLER_WEBSOCKET_PORT`` / ``ZEEK_AGENT_PORT``,
or use the following:

.. code-block:: zeek

   redef Management::Controller::default_port_websocket = 21490/tcp;
   redef Management::Controller::default_port = 21500/tcp;
   redef Management::Agent::default_port = 21510/tcp;

By default, agent and controller listen globally. To make them listen on a
specific interface, set environment variables ``ZEEK_CONTROLLER_ADDR`` /
``ZEEK_CONTROLLER_WEBSOCKET_ADDR`` / ``ZEEK_AGENT_ADDR``,
or redefine the framework's fallback default address:

.. code-block:: zeek

   redef Management::default_address = "127.0.0.1";

The framework inherits Broker's TLS capabilities and defaults. For details,
please refer to the :doc:`Broker config settings
</scripts/base/frameworks/broker/main.zeek>`.

.. note::

   ``zeek-client`` currently doesn't support client-side certificates.

Additional framework configuration
----------------------------------

The framework features a number of additional settings that we cover as needed
in the remainder of this chapter. Refer to the following to browse them all:

* :doc:`General settings </scripts/policy/frameworks/management/config.zeek>`
* :doc:`Controller </scripts/policy/frameworks/management/controller/config.zeek>`
* :doc:`Agents </scripts/policy/frameworks/management/agent/config.zeek>`
* :doc:`Cluster nodes </scripts/policy/frameworks/management/node/config.zeek>`
* :doc:`Supervisor </scripts/policy/frameworks/management/supervisor/config.zeek>`

Node Operation and Outputs
==========================

The framework places every Supervisor-created node into its own working
directory, located in ``$(zeek-config --prefix)/var/lib/nodes/<name>``. You can
reconfigure this by setting the ``ZEEK_MANAGEMENT_STATE_DIR`` or redefining
:zeek:see:`Management::state_dir`. Doing either will change the toplevel
directory (i.e., replacing the path up to and including ``var/lib`` in the
above); the framework will still create the ``nodes/<name>`` directory structure
within it.

Outputs in the resulting directory include:

* Two separate ad-hoc logs (not structured by Zeek's logging framework)
  capturing the node's stdout and stderr streams. Their naming is configurable,
  defaulting simply to ``stdout`` and ``stderr``.

* Zeek log files prior to log rotation.

* Persisted Zeek state, such as Broker-backed tables.


Log Management
==============

The framework configures log rotation and archival via Zeek's included
`zeek-archiver tool <https://github.com/zeek/zeek-archiver>`_, as follows:

* The :zeek:see:`Log::default_rotation_interval` is one hour, with both local
  and remote logging enabled. You are free to adjust it as needed.

* The log rotation directory defaults to ``$(zeek-config --prefix)/spool/log-queue``.
  To adjust this, redefine :zeek:see:`Log::default_rotation_dir` as usual.
  You can also relocate the spool by setting the ``ZEEK_MANAGEMENT_SPOOL_DIR``
  environment variable or redefining :zeek:see:`Management::spool_dir`. The
  framework will place ``log-queue`` into that new destination.

* The log rotation callback rotates node-local logs into the log queue, with
  naming suitable for ``zeek-archiver``. An example:

  .. code-block:: console

     conn__2022-06-20-10-00-00__2022-06-20-11-00-00__.log

  For details, take a look at the implementation in
  ``scripts/policy/frameworks/management/persistence.zeek``.

* Once per log rotation interval, the agent launches log archival to archive
  rotated logs into the installation's log directory (``$(zeek-config
  --root)/logs``). By default this invokes ``zeek-archiver``, which establishes
  a datestamp directory in the ``logs`` directory and places the compressed logs
  into it:

  .. code-block:: console

     # cd $(zeek-config --root)/logs
     # ls -l
     total 4
     drwx------. 2 root root 4096 Jun 20 21:17 2022-06-20
     # cd 2022-06-20
     # ls -l
     total 712
     -rw-r--r--. 1 root root   280 Jun 20 20:17 broker.19:00:00-20:00:00.log.gz
     -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 24803 Jun 20 20:17 conn.19:00:00-20:00:00.log.gz
     -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 26036 Jun 20 21:17 conn.20:00:00-21:00:00.log.gz
     -rw-r--r--. 1 root root   350 Jun 20 20:17 dhcp.19:00:00-20:00:00.log.gz
     -rw-r--r--. 1 root root   400 Jun 20 21:17 dhcp.20:00:00-21:00:00.log.gz
     ...

You can adapt the log archival configuration via the following settings:

* Redefine :zeek:see:`Management::Agent::archive_logs` to ``F`` to disable
  archival entirely.

* Redefine :zeek:see:`Management::Agent::archive_interval` for an interval other
  than the log rotation one.

* Redefine :zeek:see:`Management::Agent::archive_dir` to change the
  destination directory.

* Redefine :zeek:see:`Management::Agent::archive_cmd` to invoke an executable
  other than the included ``zeek-archiver``. The replacement should accept the
  same argument structure: ``<executable> -1 <input dir> <output dir>``. The
  ``-1`` here refers to ``zeek-archiver``'s one-shot processing mode.

.. _framework-management-zeek-client:

The zeek-client CLI
===================

Zeek ships with a command-line client for the Management framework:
``zeek-client``, installed alongside the other executables in the
distribution. It looks as follows:

.. literalinclude:: management/zeek-client-help.console
   :language: console

Run commands with ``--help`` for additional details.

The majority of ``zeek-client``'s commands send off a request to the controller,
wait for it to act on it, retrieve the response, and render it to the
console. The output is typically in JSON format, though a few commands also
support ``.ini`` output.

Looking at the :zeek:see:`Management::Controller::API` module, you'll notice
that the structure of response event arguments is fairly rigid, consisting of
one or more :zeek:see:`Management::Result` records. ``zeek-client`` does not
render these directly to JSON. Instead, it translates the responses to a more
convenient JSON format reflecting specific types of requests. Several commands
share a common output format.

.. _zeek-client-installation:

Standalone installation
-----------------------

As mentioned above, Zeek ships with ``zeek-client`` by default. Since users will
often want to use the client from machines not otherwise running Zeek, the
client is also available as a standalone Python package via ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install zeek-client

Users with custom Zeek builds who don't require a Zeek-bundled ``zeek-client``
can skip its installation by configuring their build with
``--disable-zeek-client``.

.. _zeek-client-compatibility:

Compatibility
-------------

Zeek 5.2 switched client/controller communication from Broker's native wire
format to the newer `WebSocket data transport
<https://docs.zeek.org/projects/broker/en/current/web-socket.html>`_, with
``zeek-client`` 1.2.0 being the first version to exlusively use WebSockets.
This has a few implications:

* Since Broker dedicates separate ports to the respective wire formats, the
  controller listens on TCP port 2149 for WebSocket connections, while
  TCP port 2150 remains available for connections by native-Broker clients, as well
  as by management agents connecting to the controller.

* ``zeek-client`` 1.2.0 and newer default to connecting to port 2149.

* Controllers running Zeek older than 5.2 need tweaking to listen on a WebSocket
  port, for example by saying:

  .. code-block:: console

     event zeek_init()
         {
         Broker::listen_websocket("0.0.0.0", 2149/tcp);
         }

* Older clients continue to work with Zeek 5.2 and newer.

.. _zeek-client-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

The client features a handful of configuration settings, reported when running
``zeek-client show-settings``:

.. literalinclude:: management/zeek-client-show-settings.console
   :language: console

You can override these via a configuration file, the environment variable
``ZEEK_CLIENT_CONFIG_SETTINGS``, and the ``--set`` command-line argument, in
order of increasing precedence. To identify a setting, use
``<section>.<setting>``, as shown by your client. For example, in order to
specify a controller's location on the network, you could:

* Put the following in a config file, either at its default location shown in
  the help output (usually ``$(zeek-config --prefix)/etc/zeek-client.cfg``)
  or one that you provide via ``-c``/``--configfile``:

  .. code-block:: ini

     [controller]
     host = mycontroller
     port = 21490

* Set the environment:

  .. code-block:: console

     ZEEK_CLIENT_CONFIG_SETTINGS="controller.host=mycontroller controller.port=21490"

* Use the ``--set`` option, possibly repeatedly:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ zeek-client --set controller.host=mycontroller --set controller.port=21490 ...

Other than the controller coordinates, the settings should rarely require
changing. If you're curious about their meaning, please consult the `source code
<https://github.com/zeek/zeek-client/blob/master/zeekclient/config.py>`_.

Auto-complete
-------------

On systems with an installed `argcomplete <https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/>`_
package, ``zeek-client`` features command-line auto-completion. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ zeek-client --set controller.<TAB>
   controller.host=127.0.0.1  controller.port=2149

Common cluster management tasks
===============================

With a running controller and agent, it's time start using ``zeek-client`` for
actual cluster management tasks. By default, the client will connect to a
controller running on the local system. If that doesn't match your setting,
instruct the client to contact the controller via one of the approaches shown
:ref:`earlier <zeek-client-configuration>`.

Checking connected agents
-------------------------

Use ``zeek-client get-instances`` to get a summary of agents currently peered
with the controller:

.. code-block:: console

   $ zeek-client get-instances
   {
     "agent-testbox": {
       "host": "127.0.0.1"
     }
   }

For agents connecting to the controller you'll see the above output; for agents
the controller connected to you'll also see those agent's listening ports.

Defining a cluster configuration
--------------------------------

For ``zeek-client``, cluster configurations are simple ``.ini`` files with two
types of sections: the special ``instances`` section defines the instances
involved in the cluster, represented by their agents. All other sections in the
file name individual cluster nodes and describe their roles and properties.

Here's a full-featured configuration describing the available options, assuming
a single agent running on a machine "testbox" with default settings:

.. literalinclude:: management/full-config.ini
   :language: ini

.. _simplification-instance-local:

Simplification for instance-local deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In practice you can omit many of the settings. We already saw in the
:ref:`Quickstart <framework-management-quickstart>` section that a configuration
deployed locally in a :ref:`joint agent-controller setup <joint-launch>` need
not specify any instances at all. In that case, use of the local instance
``agent-<hostname>`` is implied. If you use other agent naming or more complex
setups, every node needs to specify its instance.

Simplification for agent-to-controller connectivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In setups where agents connect to the controller, you may omit the ``instances``
section if it would merely repeat the list of instances claimed by the nodes.

Simplification for port selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All but the worker nodes in a Zeek cluster require a listening port, and you can
specify one for each node as shown in the above configuration. If you'd rather
not pick ports, the controller can auto-enumerate ports for you, as follows:

* The :zeek:see:`Management::Controller::auto_assign_broker_ports` Boolean, which defaults to
  ``T``, controls whether port auto-enumeration is active. Redefining to ``F``
  disables the feature.

* :zeek:see:`Management::Controller::auto_assign_broker_start_port` defines the starting point
  for port enumeration. This defaults to ``2200/tcp``.

* Any nodes with explicitly configured ports will keep them.

* For other nodes, the controller will assign ports first to the manager, then
  logger(s), then proxies. Within each of those groups, it first groups nodes
  in the same instance (to obtain locally sequential ports), and orders these
  alphabetically by name before enumerating. It also avoids conflicts with
  configured agent and controller ports.

* The controller does not verify that selected ports are in fact unclaimed.
  It's up to you to ensure an available pool of unclaimed listening ports from
  the start port onward.

By retrieving the deployed configuration from the controller (see the next two
sections) you can examine which ports the controller selected.

Configuration of the Telemetry framework
----------------------------------------

By default, the framework will enable Prometheus metrics exposition ports,
including a service discovery endpoint on the mananger (refer to the
:ref:`Telemetry Framework <framework-telemetry>` for details), and
auto-assign them for you. Specifically, the controller will enumerate ports
starting from
:zeek:see:`Management::Controller::auto_assign_metrics_start_port`, which
defaults to ``9000/tcp``. Any ports you define manually will be preserved.  To
disable metrics port auto-assignment, redefine
:zeek:see:`Management::Controller::auto_assign_metrics_ports` to ``F``.

Staging and deploying configurations
------------------------------------

The framework structures deployment of a cluster configuration into two
phases:

#. First, the cluster configuration is *staged*: the client uploads it to the
   controller, which validates its content, and --- upon successful validation
   --- persists this configuration to disk. Restarting the controller at this
   point will preserve this configuration in its staged state. Validation checks
   the configuration for consistency and structural errors, such as doubly
   defined nodes, port collisions, or inconsistent instance use. The controller
   only ever stores a single staged configuration.

#. Then, *deployment* applies needed finalization to the configuration (e.g. to
   auto-enumerate ports) and, assuming all needed instances have peered,
   distributes the configuration to their agents. Deployment replaces any
   preexisting Zeek cluster, shutting down the existing node processes. The
   controller also persists the deployed configuration to disk, alongside the
   staged one. Deployment does *not* need to be successful to preserve a
   deployed configuration: it's the attempt to deploy that matters.

Internally, configurations bear an identifier string to allow tracking. The
client selects this identifier, which comes with no further assurances --- for
example, identical configurations need not bear the same identifier.

To stage a configuration, use the following:

.. code-block:: console

   $ zeek-client stage-config cluster.cfg
   {
     "errors": [],
     "results": {
       "id": "5e90197a-f850-11ec-a77f-7c10c94416bb"
     }
   }

The ``errors`` array contains textual description of any validation problems
encountered, causing the client to exit with error. The reported ``id`` is the
configuration's identifier, as set by the client.

Then, trigger deployment of the staged configuration:

.. code-block:: console

   $ zeek-client deploy
   {
     "errors": [],
     "results": {
       "id": "5e90197a-f850-11ec-a77f-7c10c94416bb"
       "nodes": {
         "logger": {
           "instance": "agent-testbox4",
           "success": true
         },
         "manager": {
           "instance": "agent-testbox4",
           "success": true
         },
         "worker-01": {
           "instance": "agent-testbox4",
           "success": true
         },
         "worker-02": {
           "instance": "agent-testbox4",
           "success": true
         }
       }
     }
   }

Success! Note the matching identifiers. The errors array covers any internal
problems, and per-node summaries report the deployment outcome. In case of
launch errors in individual nodes, stdout/stderr is captured and hopefully
provides clues. Revisiting the quickstart example, let's introduce an error in
``cluster.cfg``:

.. literalinclude:: management/mini-config-with-error.ini
   :language: ini

Since staging and deployment will frequently go hand-in-hand, the client
provides the ``deploy-config`` command to combine them into one. Let's use it:

.. literalinclude:: management/mini-deployment-error.console
   :language: console

The client exits with error, the timeout error refers to the fact that one of
the launch commands timed out, and ``worker-02``'s stderr shows the problem. The
Supervisor will continue to try to launch the node with ever-increasing
reattempt delays, and keep failing.

Retrieving configurations
-------------------------

The client's ``get-config`` command lets you retrieve staged and deployed
configurations from the controller, in JSON or `.ini` form. This is helpful for
examining the differences between the two. Following the successful deployment
shown above, we have:

.. literalinclude:: management/mini-deployment-get-config-staged.console
   :language: console

You can see here how the client's :ref:`instance-local simplification
<simplification-instance-local>` filled in instances under the hood.

The ``.ini`` output is reusable as deployable configuration. The same
configuration is available in JSON, showing more detail:

.. literalinclude:: management/mini-deployment-get-config-staged-json.console
   :language: console

Finally, you can also retrieve the deployed configuration (in either format):

.. literalinclude:: management/mini-deployment-get-config-deployed.console
   :language: console

Note the manager's and logger's auto-enumerated ports in this one.

Showing the current instance nodes
----------------------------------

To see the current node status as visible to the Supervisors in each agent's
instance, use the ``get-nodes`` command:

.. literalinclude:: management/mini-deployment-get-nodes.console
   :language: console

This groups nodes by instances, while also showing agents and controllers, so
``agent-testbox`` shows up twice in the above. Nodes can be in two states,
``PENDING`` upon launch and before the new node has checked in with the agent,
and ``RUNNING`` once that has happened. Nodes also have a role either in cluster
management (as ``AGENT`` or ``CONTROLLER``), or in the Zeek cluster. The
information shown per node essentially reflects the framework's
:zeek:see:`Management::NodeStatus` record.

Showing current global identifier values
----------------------------------------

For troubleshooting scripts in production it can be very handy to verify the
contents of global variables in specific nodes. The client supports this via the
``get-id-value`` command. To use it, specify the name of a global identifier, as
well as any node names from which you'd like to retrieve it. The framework
renders the value to JSON directly in the queried cluster node, side-stepping
potential serialization issues for complex types, and integrates the result in
the response:

.. literalinclude:: management/get-id-value-simple.console
   :language: console

.. literalinclude:: management/get-id-value-complex.console
   :language: console

Restarting cluster nodes
------------------------

The ``restart`` command allows you to restart specific cluster nodes, or the
entire cluster. Note that this refers only to the operational cluster (manager,
workers, etc) --- this will not restart any agents or a co-located controller.

Here's the current manager:

.. code-block:: console

   $ zeek-client get-nodes | jq '.results."agent-testbox".manager'
   {
     "cluster_role": "MANAGER",
     "mgmt_role": null,
     "pid": 54073,
     "port": 2200,
     "state": "RUNNING"
   }

Let's restart it:

.. code-block:: console

   $ zeek-client restart manager
   {
     "errors": [],
     "results": {
       "manager": true
     }
   }

It's back up and running (note the PID change):

.. code-block:: console

   $ zeek-client get-nodes | jq '.results."agent-testbox".manager'
   {
     "cluster_role": "MANAGER",
     "mgmt_role": null,
     "pid": 68752,
     "port": 2200,
     "state": "RUNNING"
   }
