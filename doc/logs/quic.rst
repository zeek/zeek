Overview
========

The QUIC protocol integrates encryption, stream multiplexing and flow control at
the transport layer. QUIC uses TLS 1.3 by default. Zeek's QUIC analyzer
provides greater observability into the protocols TLS handshake.


Example
=======

An example of a :file:`quic.log`.

.. code-block:: console

    zeek@zeek-6.1:~ zeek -C LogAscii::use_json=T -r chromium-115.0.5790.110-api-cirrus-com.pcap
    zeek@zeek-6.1:~ jq . quic.log

:zeek:see:`QUIC::Info` provides further details on the current output of the
:file:`quic.log`. Current fields include:

- **version**: The version of QUIC that was identified.


- **client_initial_dcid**: When QUIC initiates a connection it uses Random
  Number Generators to create the first Destination Connection ID (DCID). This
  DCID is subsequently used for routing and packet protection by client and
  server.


- **server_scid**: A QUIC supported server responds to a DCID by
  selecting a Source Connection ID (SCID). This usually occurs within the
  serverâ€™s first INITIAL packet. This is typically used by the client in
  subsequent packets, although the SCID can change to adapt to new network
  conditions.


- **client_protocol**: If the ClientHello packet is successfully extracted
  and contains the ALPN extension, the extension's first entry is placed in
  client_protocol.


- **history**: An experimental feature provides a history of the QUIC
  protocol usage. In the example above the history outlines:

    + An initial packet from the client (I) - a new connection


    + An TLS ClientHello from the client (S) - the start of a
      TLS handshake


    + An initial packet from the server (i) - an acknowledgement
      from the server of the new connection


    + A TLS ServerHello response from the server (s) - the
      selection  of a cipher suite from the options provided by the
      client

    + A handshake packet from the client (H)



Conclusion
==========

The QUIC analyzer is an initial attempt to provide observability into QUIC
network traffic. In Zeek 6.1, although included by default, the QUIC analyzer is
still considered experimental. Contributions, feedback and issues can be reported
via `Github, Slack or the forum <https://zeek.org/community/>`_.
