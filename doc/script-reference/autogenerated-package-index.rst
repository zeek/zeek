   in "option" values at run-time.

:doc:`base/frameworks/analyzer </scripts/base/frameworks/analyzer/index>`

   protocol analyzers, as well as to manage the well-known ports which
   automatically activate a particular analyzer for new connections.

:doc:`base/frameworks/files </scripts/base/frameworks/files/index>`

   The file analysis framework provides an interface for driving the analysis
   of files, possibly independent of any network protocol over which they're
   transported.

:doc:`base/frameworks/files/magic </scripts/base/frameworks/files/magic/index>`


:doc:`base/bif </scripts/base/bif/index>`


:doc:`base/bif/plugins </scripts/base/bif/plugins/index>`


:doc:`base/frameworks/reporter </scripts/base/frameworks/reporter/index>`

   This framework is intended to create an output and filtering path for
   internally generated messages/warnings/errors.

:doc:`base/frameworks/notice </scripts/base/frameworks/notice/index>`

   The notice framework enables Zeek to "notice" things which are odd or
   potentially bad, leaving it to the local configuration to define which
   of them are actionable.  This decoupling of detection and reporting allows
   Zeek to be customized to the different needs that sites have.

:doc:`base/frameworks/signatures </scripts/base/frameworks/signatures/index>`

   The signature framework provides for doing low-level pattern matching.  While
   signatures are not Zeek's preferred detection tool, they sometimes come in
   handy and are closer to what many people are familiar with from using
   other NIDS.

:doc:`base/frameworks/packet-filter </scripts/base/frameworks/packet-filter/index>`

   The packet filter framework supports how Zeek sets its BPF capture filter.

:doc:`base/frameworks/software </scripts/base/frameworks/software/index>`

   of software versions seen on the network. The version parsing itself
   is carried out by external protocol-specific scripts that feed into
   this framework.

:doc:`base/frameworks/intel </scripts/base/frameworks/intel/index>`

   The intelligence framework provides a way to store and query intelligence
   data (such as IP addresses or strings). Metadata can also be associated

   The summary statistics framework provides a way to summarize large streams
   of data into simple reduced measurements.

   Plugins for the summary statistics framework.

:doc:`base/frameworks/tunnels </scripts/base/frameworks/tunnels/index>`

   necessary to interface to OpenFlow capable hardware.

:doc:`base/frameworks/openflow/plugins </scripts/base/frameworks/openflow/plugins/index>`

   Plugins for the OpenFlow framework.

:doc:`base/frameworks/netcontrol </scripts/base/frameworks/netcontrol/index>`

   hard- and software, e.g. for dropping and shunting IP addresses/connections,
   etc.

   Support for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).
   
   Note that currently the XMPP analyzer only supports analyzing XMPP sessions
   until they do or do not switch to TLS using StartTLS. Hence, we do not get
   actual chat information from XMPP sessions, only X509 certificates.

:doc:`base/files/pe </scripts/base/files/pe/index>`

   Support for Portable Executable (PE) file analysis.

:doc:`base/files/extract </scripts/base/files/extract/index>`

   Collective Intelligence Framework (CIF) since Zeek's Intel framework
   doesn't natively behave the same as CIF nor does it store and maintain
   the same data in all cases.
