Types
#####
.. zeek:type:: Files::AnalyzerArgs
   :source-code: base/frameworks/files/main.zeek 21 32

   :Type: :zeek:type:`record`

      chunk_event: :zeek:type:`event` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`, data: :zeek:type:`string`, off: :zeek:type:`count`) :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         An event which will be generated for all new file contents,
         chunk-wise.  Used when *tag* (in the
         :zeek:see:`Files::add_analyzer` function) is
         :zeek:see:`Files::ANALYZER_DATA_EVENT`.

      stream_event: :zeek:type:`event` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`, data: :zeek:type:`string`) :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         An event which will be generated for all new file contents,
         stream-wise.  Used when *tag* is
         :zeek:see:`Files::ANALYZER_DATA_EVENT`.

      extract_filename: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         (present if :doc:`/scripts/base/files/extract/main.zeek` is loaded)

         The local filename to which to write an extracted file.
         This field is used in the core by the extraction plugin
         to know where to write the file to.  If not specified, then
         a filename in the format "extract-<source>-<id>" is
         automatically assigned (using the *source* and *id*
         fields of :zeek:see:`fa_file`).

      extract_limit: :zeek:type:`count` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`FileExtract::default_limit` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         (present if :doc:`/scripts/base/files/extract/main.zeek` is loaded)

         The maximum allowed file size in bytes of *extract_filename*.
         Once reached, a :zeek:see:`file_extraction_limit` event is
         raised and the analyzer will be removed unless
         :zeek:see:`FileExtract::set_limit` is called to increase the
         limit.  A value of zero means "no limit".

      extract_limit_includes_missing: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`FileExtract::default_limit_includes_missing` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         (present if :doc:`/scripts/base/files/extract/main.zeek` is loaded)

         By default, missing bytes in files count towards the extract file size.
         Missing bytes can, e.g., occur due to missed traffic, or offsets
         used when downloading files.
         Setting this option to false changes this behavior so that holes
         in files do no longer count towards these limits. Files with
         holes are created as sparse files on disk. Their apparent size
         can exceed this file size limit.
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`

   A structure which parameterizes a type of file analysis.

.. zeek:type:: Files::Info
   :source-code: base/frameworks/files/main.zeek 37 116

         network connection, this is the uid for the connection.

      id: :zeek:type:`conn_id` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         If this file, or parts of it, were transferred over a
         network connection, this shows the connection.

      source: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         An identification of the source of the file data.  E.g. it
         may be a network protocol over which it was transferred, or a
         local file path which was read, or some other input source.

      depth: :zeek:type:`count` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``0`` :zeek:attr:`&optional` :zeek:attr:`&log`

         to its source.  In SMTP, it is the depth of the MIME
         attachment on the message.  In HTTP, it is the depth of the
         request within the TCP connection.

      analyzers: :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`string`] :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``{  }`` :zeek:attr:`&optional` :zeek:attr:`&log`

      mime_type: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`

         match against the *bof_buffer* field of :zeek:see:`fa_file`,
         or in the cases where no buffering of the beginning of file
         occurs, an initial guess of the mime type based on the first
         data seen.

      filename: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A filename for the file if one is available from the source
         for the file.  These will frequently come from
         "Content-Disposition" headers in network protocols.

      duration: :zeek:type:`interval` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``0 secs`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`

         determined by the configured :zeek:see:`Site::local_nets`.

      is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         If the source of this file is a network connection, this field
         indicates if the file is being sent by the originator of the
         connection or the responder.

         Number of bytes provided to the file analysis engine for the file.
         The value refers to the total number of bytes processed for this
         file across all connections seen by the current Zeek instance.

      total_bytes: :zeek:type:`count` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Total number of bytes that are supposed to comprise the full file.

      missing_bytes: :zeek:type:`count` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``0`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The number of bytes in the file stream that were completely missed
         during the process of analysis e.g. due to dropped packets.
         The value refers to number of bytes missed for this file
         across all connections seen by the current Zeek instance.

      overflow_bytes: :zeek:type:`count` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``0`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The number of bytes in the file stream that were not delivered to
         stream file analyzers.  This could be overlapping bytes or
         bytes that couldn't be reassembled.

      timedout: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``F`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`

   Register a callback for file analyzers to use if they need to do some
   manipulation when they are being added to a file before the core code
   takes over.  This is unlikely to be interesting for users and should
   only be called by file analyzer authors but is *not required*.
   

   :param tag: Tag for the file analyzer.

   Registers a MIME type for an analyzer. If a future file with this type is seen,
   the analyzer will be automatically assigned to parsing it. The function *adds*
   to all MIME types already registered, it doesn't replace them.
   

   :param tag: The tag of the analyzer.
   

   :param mt: The MIME type in the form "foo/bar" (case-insensitive).

   them.
   

   :param tag: The tag of the analyzer.
   

   :param mts: The set of MIME types, each in the form "foo/bar" (case-insensitive).
   

   :returns: True if the MIME types were successfully registered.

   Sets the *timeout_interval* field of :zeek:see:`fa_file`, which is
   used to determine the length of inactivity that is allowed for a file
   before internal state related to it is cleaned up.  When used within
   a :zeek:see:`file_timeout` handler, the analysis will delay timing out
   again for the period specified by *t*.
   

   :param f: the file.
   

   :param t: the amount of time the file can remain inactive before discarding.
   

   :returns: true if the timeout interval was set, or false if analysis

   :param f: the file.
   

   :returns: true if analysis for the given file will be ignored for the
            rest of its contents, or false if analysis for the file
            isn't currently active.
