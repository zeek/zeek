.. zeek:namespace:: Intel

The intelligence framework provides a way to store and query intelligence
data (e.g. IP addresses, URLs and hashes). The intelligence items can be
associated with metadata to allow informed decisions about matching and
handling.

   The expiration timeout for intelligence items. Once an item expires, the
   :zeek:id:`Intel::item_expired` hook is called. Reinsertion of an item
   resets the timeout. A negative value disables expiration of intelligence
   items.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (s: :zeek:type:`Intel::Seen`, items: :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`Intel::Item`])

   Event to represent a match in the intelligence data from data that
   was seen. On clusters there is no assurance as to when this event
   will be generated so do not assume that arbitrary global state beyond
   the given data will be available.
   
   This is the primary mechanism where a user may take actions based on
   data provided by the intelligence framework.

   This hook can be used to influence the logging of intelligence hits
   (e.g. by adding data to the Info record). The default information is
   added with a priority of 5.
   

   :param info: The Info record that will be logged.
   

   :param s: Information about the data seen.
   

   :param items: The intel items that match the seen data.
   
   In case the hook execution is terminated using break, the match will
   not be logged.

   :source-code: policy/frameworks/intel/removal.zeek 14 22

   :Type: :zeek:type:`hook` (item: :zeek:type:`Intel::Item`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   This hook can be used to filter intelligence items that are about to be
   inserted into the internal data store. In case the hook execution is
   terminated using break, the item will not be (re)added to the internal
   data store.
   

   :param item: The intel item that should be inserted.

   This hook is invoked when a new indicator has been inserted into
   the min data store for the first time.
   
   Calls to :zeek:see:`Intel::seen` with a matching indicator value
   and type will result in matches.
   
   Subsequent inserts of the same indicator type and value do not
   invoke this hook. Breaking from this hook has no effect.
   

   :param indicator: The indicator value.
   

   :param indicator_type: The indicator type.
   
   .. zeek::see:: Intel::indicator_removed

   :Type: :zeek:type:`hook` (indicator: :zeek:type:`string`, indiator_type: :zeek:type:`Intel::Type`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   This hook is invoked when an indicator has been removed from
   the min data store.
   
   After this hooks runs, :zeek:see:`Intel::seen` for the indicator
   will not return any matches. Breaking from this hook has no effect.
   

   :param indicator: The indicator value.
   

   :param indicator_type: The indicator type.
   
   .. zeek::see:: Intel::indicator_inserted

.. zeek:id:: Intel::item_expired
   :source-code: policy/frameworks/intel/do_expire.zeek 10 14

   :Type: :zeek:type:`hook` (indicator: :zeek:type:`string`, indicator_type: :zeek:type:`Intel::Type`, metas: :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`Intel::MetaData`]) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   This hook can be used to handle expiration of intelligence items.
   

   :param indicator: The indicator of the expired item.
   

   :param indicator_type: The indicator type of the expired item.
   

   :param metas: The set of metadata describing the expired item.
   
   If all hook handlers are executed, the expiration timeout will be reset.
   Otherwise, if one of the handlers terminates using break, the item will
   be removed.

.. zeek:id:: Intel::log_policy
   :source-code: base/frameworks/intel/main.zeek 13 13

   :Type: :zeek:type:`Log::PolicyHook`


.. zeek:id:: Intel::seen_policy
   :source-code: base/frameworks/intel/main.zeek 181 181

   :Type: :zeek:type:`hook` (s: :zeek:type:`Intel::Seen`, found: :zeek:type:`bool`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Hook to modify and intercept :zeek:see:`Intel::seen` behavior.
   
   This hook is invoked after the Intel datastore was searched for
   a given :zeek:see:`Intel::Seen` instance. If a matching entry was
   found, the *found* argument is set to ``T``, else ``F``.
   
   Breaking from this hook suppresses :zeek:see:`Intel::match`
   event generation and any subsequent logging.
   
   Note that this hook only runs on the Zeek node where :zeek:see:`Intel::seen`
   is invoked. In a cluster configuration that is usually on the worker nodes.
   This is in contrast to :zeek:see:`Intel::match` that usually runs
   centrally on the the manager node instead.
   

   :param s: The :zeek:see:`Intel::Seen` instance passed to the :zeek:see:`Intel::seen` function.
   

   :param found: ``T`` if Intel datastore contained *s*, else ``F``.

Functions
#########
.. zeek:id:: Intel::insert
   :source-code: base/frameworks/intel/main.zeek 596 603

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (item: :zeek:type:`Intel::Item`) : :zeek:type:`void`

   Function to insert intelligence data. If the indicator is already
   present, the associated metadata will be added to the indicator. If
   the indicator already contains a metadata record from the same source,
   the existing metadata record will be updated.

.. zeek:id:: Intel::remove
   :source-code: base/frameworks/intel/main.zeek 649 688

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (item: :zeek:type:`Intel::Item`, purge_indicator: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``F`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`) : :zeek:type:`void`

   Function to remove intelligence data. If purge_indicator is set, the
   given metadata is ignored and the indicator is removed completely.

.. zeek:id:: Intel::seen
   :source-code: base/frameworks/intel/main.zeek 405 433

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (s: :zeek:type:`Intel::Seen`) : :zeek:type:`void`

   Function to declare discovery of a piece of data in order to check
   it against known intelligence for matches.
