.. zeek:namespace:: GLOBAL
.. zeek:namespace:: Notice

This is the notice framework which enables Zeek to "notice" things which
are odd or potentially bad.  Decisions of the meaning of various notices
need to be done per site because Zeek does not ship with assumptions about
what is bad activity for sites.  More extensive documentation about using
the notice framework can be found in :doc:`/frameworks/notice`.

Types
#####

:zeek:type:`Notice::Action`: :zeek:type:`enum`     These are values representing actions that can be taken with notices.
:zeek:type:`Notice::ActionSet`: :zeek:type:`set`   Type that represents a set of actions.
:zeek:type:`Notice::FileInfo`: :zeek:type:`record` Contains a portion of :zeek:see:`fa_file` that's also contained in
                                                   :zeek:see:`Notice::Info`.

:zeek:type:`Notice::Type`: :zeek:type:`enum`       Scripts creating new notices need to redef this enum to add their
                                                   own specific notice types which would then get used when they call
                                                   the :zeek:id:`NOTICE` function.

         Indicates that the notice should have geodata added for the

      fuid: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A file unique ID if this notice is related to a file.  If
         the *f* field is provided, this will be automatically filled
         out.

      file_mime_type: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A mime type if the notice is related to a file.  If the *f*

      file_desc: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Frequently files can be "described" to give a bit more
         context.  This field will typically be automatically filled
         out from an fa_file record.  For example, if a notice was
         related to a file over HTTP, the URL of the request would
         be shown.

      proto: :zeek:type:`transport_proto` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`

         Source address, if we don't have a :zeek:type:`conn_id`.

      dst: :zeek:type:`addr` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Destination address.

      p: :zeek:type:`port` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Associated port, if we don't have a :zeek:type:`conn_id`.

      n: :zeek:type:`count` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Associated count, or perhaps a status code.

      peer_name: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Name of remote peer that raised this notice.

      peer_descr: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Textual description for the peer that raised this notice,
         including name, host address and port.

      actions: :zeek:type:`Notice::ActionSet` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``{  }`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The actions which have been applied to this notice.

      email_dest: :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`string`] :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``{  }`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The email address(es) where to send this notice

      email_body_sections: :zeek:type:`vector` of :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         By adding chunks of text into this element, other scripts
         can expand on notices that are being emailed.  The normal
         way to add text is to extend the vector by handling the
         :zeek:id:`Notice::notice` event and modifying the notice in
         place.

      email_delay_tokens: :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`string`] :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Adding a string "token" to this set will cause the notice
         framework's built-in emailing functionality to delay sending
         the email until either the token has been removed or the
         email has been delayed for :zeek:id:`Notice::max_email_delay`.

      identifier: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         This field is to be provided when a notice is generated for
         the purpose of deduplicating notices.  The identifier string
         should be unique for a single instance of the notice.  This
         field should be filled out in almost all cases when
         generating notices to define when a notice is conceptually
         a duplicate of a previous notice.
         
         For example, an SSL certificate that is going to expire soon
         should always have the same identifier no matter the client
         IP address that connected and resulted in the certificate
         being exposed.  In this case, the resp_h, resp_p, and hash
         of the certificate would be used to create this value.  The
         hash of the cert is included because servers can return
         multiple certificates on the same port.
         
         Another example might be a host downloading a file which
         triggered a notice because the MD5 sum of the file it
         downloaded was known by some set of intelligence.  In that
         case, the orig_h (client) and MD5 sum would be used in this
         field to dedup because if the same file is downloaded over
         and over again you really only want to know about it a
         single time.  This makes it possible to send those notices
         to email without worrying so much about sending thousands
         of emails.

         Omitting comments is fine, and so is mixing ``##`` and ``##<``, but
         it's probably best to use only one style consistently.

   Scripts creating new notices need to redef this enum to add their
   own specific notice types which would then get used when they call
   the :zeek:id:`NOTICE` function.  The convention is to give a general
   category along with the specific notice separating words with
   underscores and using leading capitals on each word except for
   abbreviations which are kept in all capitals. For example,
   SSH::Password_Guessing is for hosts that have crossed a threshold of
   failed SSH logins.
