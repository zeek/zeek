.. zeek:namespace:: PacketFilter

This script supports how Zeek sets its BPF capture filter.  By default
Zeek sets a capture filter that allows all traffic.  If a filter
is set on the command line, that filter takes precedence over the default
open filter and all filters defined in Zeek scripts with the
:zeek:id:`capture_filters` and :zeek:id:`restrict_filters` variables.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`string`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`
   :Default: ``"ip or not ip"``

   The BPF filter that is used by default to define what traffic should
   be captured.  Filters defined in :zeek:id:`restrict_filters` will
   still be applied to reduce the captured traffic.

.. zeek:id:: PacketFilter::enable_auto_protocol_capture_filters
   :source-code: base/frameworks/packet-filter/main.zeek 131 131

   :Type: :zeek:type:`bool`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`
   :Default: ``F``

   Enables the old filtering approach of "only watch common ports for
   analyzed protocols".
   
   Unless you know what you are doing, leave this set to F.

.. zeek:id:: PacketFilter::max_filter_compile_time
   :source-code: base/frameworks/packet-filter/main.zeek 74 74

   :Type: :zeek:type:`interval`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`
   :Default: ``100.0 msecs``

   The maximum amount of time that you'd like to allow for BPF filters to compile.
   If this time is exceeded, compensation measures may be taken by the framework
   to reduce the filter size.  This threshold being crossed also results
   in the :zeek:see:`PacketFilter::Too_Long_To_Compile_Filter` notice.

.. zeek:id:: PacketFilter::restricted_filter
   :source-code: base/frameworks/packet-filter/main.zeek 68 68

   :Type: :zeek:type:`string`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`
   :Default: ``""``

   Filter string which is unconditionally and'ed to the beginning of
   every dynamically built filter.  This is mostly used when a custom
   filter is being used but MPLS or VLAN tags are on the traffic.

.. zeek:id:: PacketFilter::unrestricted_filter
   :source-code: base/frameworks/packet-filter/main.zeek 63 63

   :Type: :zeek:type:`string`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`
   :Default: ``""``

   Filter string which is unconditionally or'ed to the beginning of
   every dynamically built filter.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`record`

      ts: :zeek:type:`time` :zeek:attr:`&log`
         The time at which the packet filter installation attempt was made.

      node: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         This is a string representation of the node that applied this
         packet filter.  It's mostly useful in the context of
         dynamically changing filters on clusters.

      filter: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log`
         The packet filter that is being set.

      init: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``F`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Indicate if this is the filter set during initialization.

      success: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``T`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Indicate if the filter was applied successfully.

      failure_reason: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A string reason why the filter failed to be created/installed.

   logging stream.

   positively match what is to be excluded, it will be wrapped in
   a "not".

   through the BPF filter.  The filter should match the traffic you
   don't want to see (it will be wrapped in a "not" condition).

              the filter.
   

   :param filter: A BPF expression of traffic that should be excluded.

   Call this function to build and install a new dynamically built
   packet filter.

   :source-code: base/frameworks/packet-filter/main.zeek 201 204

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (fp: :zeek:type:`PacketFilter::FilterPlugin`) : :zeek:type:`void`

   :source-code: base/frameworks/packet-filter/main.zeek 211 220

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (filter_id: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Remove a previously added exclude filter fragment by name. The
   traffic that was being filtered will be allowed through the filter
   after calling this function.
   

   :param filter_id: The name given to the filter fragment which you'd like to remove.
   

   :returns: A boolean value to indicate if a filter fragment with the given name
