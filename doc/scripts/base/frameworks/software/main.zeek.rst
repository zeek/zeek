==================================
.. zeek:namespace:: Software

This script provides the framework for software version detection and
parsing but doesn't actually do any detection on it's own.  It relies on
other protocol specific scripts to parse out software from the protocols
that they analyze.  The entry point for providing new software detections
to this framework is through the :zeek:id:`Software::found` function.

   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`
   :Default: ``LOCAL_HOSTS``
   :Redefinition: from :doc:`/scripts/policy/tuning/track-all-assets.zeek`

      ``=``::

         ALL_HOSTS


   Hosts whose software should be detected and tracked.
   Choices are: LOCAL_HOSTS, REMOTE_HOSTS, ALL_HOSTS, NO_HOSTS.

State Variables
###############
.. zeek:id:: Software::alternate_names
   :source-code: base/frameworks/software/main.zeek 98 98

   :Type: :zeek:type:`table` [:zeek:type:`string`] of :zeek:type:`string`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:type:`function`
   :Default:

      ::

         {
            ["Flash Player"] = "Flash"
         }


   Sometimes software will expose itself on the network with
   slight naming variations.  This table provides a mechanism
   for a piece of software to be renamed to a single name
   even if it exposes itself with an alternate name.  The
   yielded string is the name that will be logged and generally
   used for everything.

.. zeek:id:: Software::tracked
   :source-code: base/frameworks/software/main.zeek 112 112

   :Type: :zeek:type:`table` [:zeek:type:`addr`] of :zeek:type:`Software::SoftwareSet`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&create_expire` = ``1.0 day``
   :Default: ``{}``

   The set of software associated with an address.  Data expires from
   this table after one day by default so that a detected piece of
   software will be logged once each day.  In a cluster, this table is
   uniformly distributed among proxy nodes.

Types
#####
.. zeek:type:: Software::Info
   :source-code: base/frameworks/software/main.zeek 43 70

   :Type: :zeek:type:`record`

      ts: :zeek:type:`time` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The time at which the software was detected.

      host: :zeek:type:`addr` :zeek:attr:`&log`
         The IP address detected running the software.

      host_p: :zeek:type:`port` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The port on which the software is running. Only sensible for
         server software.

      software_type: :zeek:type:`Software::Type` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``Software::UNKNOWN`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The type of software detected (e.g. :zeek:enum:`HTTP::SERVER`).

      name: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Name of the software (e.g. Apache).

      version: :zeek:type:`Software::Version` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Version of the software.

      unparsed_version: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&log` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The full unparsed version string found because the version
         parsing doesn't always work reliably in all cases and this
         acts as a fallback in the logs.

      force_log: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``F`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         This can indicate that this software being detected should
         definitely be sent onward to the logging framework.  By
         default, only software that is "interesting" due to a change
         in version or it being currently unknown is sent to the
         logging framework.  This can be set to T to force the record
         to be sent to the logging framework if some amount of this
         tracking needs to happen in a specific way to the software.
