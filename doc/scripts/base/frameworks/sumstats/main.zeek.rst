.. zeek:type:: SumStats::SumStat
   :source-code: base/frameworks/sumstats/main.zeek 91 144

   :Type: :zeek:type:`record`

      name: :zeek:type:`string`
         An arbitrary name for the sumstat so that it can
         be referred to later.

      epoch: :zeek:type:`interval`
         The interval at which this sumstat should be "broken"
         and the *epoch_result* callback called. The
         results are also reset at this time so any threshold
         based detection needs to be set to a
         value that should be expected to happen within
         this epoch.
         
         Passing an epoch of zero (e.g. ``0 secs``) causes this
         sumstat to be set to manual epochs. You will have to manually
         end the epoch by calling :zeek:see:`SumStats::next_epoch`.

      reducers: :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`SumStats::Reducer`]
         The reducers for the SumStat.

      threshold_val: :zeek:type:`function` (key: :zeek:type:`SumStats::Key`, result: :zeek:type:`SumStats::Result`) : :zeek:type:`double` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A function that will be called once for each observation in order
         to calculate a value from the :zeek:see:`SumStats::Result` structure
         which will be used for thresholding.
         This function is required if a *threshold* value or
         a *threshold_series* is given.

      threshold: :zeek:type:`double` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The threshold value for calling the *threshold_crossed* callback.
         If you need more than one threshold value, then use
         *threshold_series* instead.

      threshold_series: :zeek:type:`vector` of :zeek:type:`double` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A series of thresholds for calling the *threshold_crossed*
         callback.  These thresholds must be listed in ascending order,
         because a threshold is not checked until the preceding one has
         been crossed.

      threshold_crossed: :zeek:type:`function` (key: :zeek:type:`SumStats::Key`, result: :zeek:type:`SumStats::Result`) : :zeek:type:`void` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A callback that is called when a threshold is crossed.
         A threshold is crossed when the value returned from *threshold_val*
         is greater than or equal to the threshold value, but only the first
         time this happens within an epoch.

      epoch_result: :zeek:type:`function` (ts: :zeek:type:`time`, key: :zeek:type:`SumStats::Key`, result: :zeek:type:`SumStats::Result`) : :zeek:type:`void` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A callback that receives each of the results at the
         end of the analysis epoch.  The function will be
         called once for each key.

      epoch_finished: :zeek:type:`function` (ts: :zeek:type:`time`) : :zeek:type:`void` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A callback that will be called when a single collection
         interval is completed.  The *ts* value will be the time of
         when the collection started.

   Represents a SumStat, which consists of an aggregation of reducers along
   with mechanisms to handle various situations like the epoch ending
   or thresholds being crossed.
   
   It's best to not access any global state outside
   of the variables given to the callbacks because there
   is no assurance provided as to where the callbacks
   will be executed on clusters.

Functions
#########
.. zeek:id:: SumStats::create
   :source-code: base/frameworks/sumstats/main.zeek 392 437

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (ss: :zeek:type:`SumStats::SumStat`) : :zeek:type:`void`

   Create a summary statistic.
   

   :param ss: The SumStat to create.

.. zeek:id:: SumStats::key2str
   :source-code: base/frameworks/sumstats/main.zeek 285 293

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (key: :zeek:type:`SumStats::Key`) : :zeek:type:`string`

   Helper function to represent a :zeek:type:`SumStats::Key` value as
   a simple string.
   

   :param key: The metric key that is to be converted into a string.
   

   :returns: A string representation of the metric key.

.. zeek:id:: SumStats::next_epoch
   :source-code: base/frameworks/sumstats/main.zeek 272 283

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (ss_name: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Manually end the current epoch for a sumstat. Calling this function will
   cause the end of the epoch processing of sumstats to start. Note that the
   epoch will not end immediately - especially in a cluster settings, a number
   of messages need to be exchanged between the cluster nodes.
   
   Note that this function only can be called if the sumstat was created with
   an epoch time of zero (manual epochs).
   
   In a cluster, this function must be called on the manager; it will not have
   any effect when called on workers.
   

   :param ss_name: SumStat name.
   

   :returns: true on success, false on failure. Failures can be: sumstat not found,
            or sumstat not created for manual epochs.

   Add data into an observation stream. This should be
   called when a script has measured some point value.
   

   :param id: The observation stream identifier that the data
       point represents.
   

   :param key: The key that the value is related to.
   

   :param obs: The data point to send into the stream.

.. zeek:id:: SumStats::request_key
