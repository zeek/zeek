.. zeek:type:: Exec::Command
   :source-code: base/utils/exec.zeek 8 20

   :Type: :zeek:type:`record`

      cmd: :zeek:type:`string`
         The command line to execute.  Use care to avoid injection
         attacks (i.e., if the command uses untrusted/variable data,
         sanitize it with :zeek:see:`safe_shell_quote`).

      stdin: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``""`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Provide standard input to the program as a string.

      read_files: :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`string`] :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         If additional files are required to be read in as part of the
         output of the command they can be defined here.

      uid: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``q3FkxySjt2a`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The unique id for tracking executors.


.. zeek:type:: Exec::Result
   :source-code: base/utils/exec.zeek 22 34

   :Type: :zeek:type:`record`

      exit_code: :zeek:type:`count` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``0`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Exit code from the program.

      signal_exit: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``F`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         True if the command was terminated with a signal.

      stdout: :zeek:type:`vector` of :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Each line of standard output.

      stderr: :zeek:type:`vector` of :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Each line of standard error.

      files: :zeek:type:`table` [:zeek:type:`string`] of :zeek:type:`string_vec` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         If additional files were requested to be read in
         the content of the files will be available here.


Functions
#########
.. zeek:id:: Exec::run
   :source-code: base/utils/exec.zeek 153 187

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (cmd: :zeek:type:`Exec::Command`) : :zeek:type:`Exec::Result`

   Function for running command line programs and getting
   output.  This is an asynchronous function which is meant
   to be run with the `when` statement.
   

   :param cmd: The command to run.  Use care to avoid injection attacks!
   

   :returns: A record representing the full results from the
            external program execution.
