are used by both cluster agent and controller, and several have corresponding
implementations in zeek-client.

   each :zeek:see:`Management::Result` indicates the outcome of a
   launched cluster node. If a node does not launch properly (meaning
   it doesn't check in with the agent on the machine it's running on),
   the result will indicate failure, and its data field will be an
   instance of this record, capturing the stdout and stderr output of
   the failing node.

.. zeek:type:: Management::NodeStatus
   :source-code: policy/frameworks/management/types.zeek 78 94

   :Type: :zeek:type:`record`

         a PID when a node is still bootstrapping.

      p: :zeek:type:`port` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The node's Broker peering listening port, if any.

         True if successful

      instance: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Name of associated instance (for context)

      data: :zeek:type:`any` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Addl data returned for successful operation

      error: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&optional`

   contain one, others multiple of these. The request ID allows clients
   to string requests and responses together. Agents and the controller
   fill in the instance and node fields whenever there's sufficient
   context to define them. Any result produced by an agent will carry an
   instance value, for example.

      .. zeek:enum:: Management::NODE Management::Role

         A managed cluster node (worker, manager, etc).

   Management infrastructure node type. This intentionally does not
   include the managed cluster node types (worker, logger, etc) -- those
   continue to be managed by the cluster framework.

.. zeek:type:: Management::State

      .. zeek:enum:: Management::UNKNOWN Management::State

         State not known currently (e.g., because of lost connectivity)

   State that a Cluster Node can be in. State changes trigger an
   API notification (see notify_change()). The Pending state corresponds
   to the Supervisor not yet reporting a PID for a node when it has not
   yet fully launched.
