   Event is raised when catch and release cases management of an IP address because no
   activity was seen within the watch_until period.
   

   :param a: The address that is no longer being managed.
   

   :param bi: The :zeek:see:`NetControl::BlockInfo` record containing information about the block.

.. zeek:id:: NetControl::log_netcontrol_catch_release

Functions
#########
.. zeek:id:: NetControl::catch_release_seen
   :source-code: policy/frameworks/netcontrol/catch-and-release.zeek 462 526

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (a: :zeek:type:`addr`) : :zeek:type:`void`

   This function can be called to notify the catch and release script that activity by
   an IP address was seen. If the respective IP address is currently monitored by catch and
   release and not blocked, the block will be reinstated. See the documentation of watch_new_connection
   which events the catch and release functionality usually monitors for activity.
   

   :param a: The address that was seen and should be re-dropped if it is being watched.

.. zeek:id:: NetControl::drop_address_catch_release
   :source-code: policy/frameworks/netcontrol/catch-and-release.zeek 373 434

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (a: :zeek:type:`addr`, location: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``""`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`) : :zeek:type:`NetControl::BlockInfo`

   Stops all packets involving an IP address from being forwarded. This function
   uses catch-and-release functionality, where the IP address is only dropped for
   a short amount of time that is incremented steadily when the IP is encountered
   again.
   
   In cluster mode, this function works on workers as well as the manager. On managers,
   the returned :zeek:see:`NetControl::BlockInfo` record will not contain the block ID,
   which will be assigned on the manager.
   

   :param a: The address to be dropped.
   

   :param t: How long to drop it, with 0 being indefinitely.
   

   :param location: An optional string describing where the drop was triggered.
   

   :returns: The :zeek:see:`NetControl::BlockInfo` record containing information about
            the inserted block.

.. zeek:id:: NetControl::get_catch_release_info
   :source-code: policy/frameworks/netcontrol/catch-and-release.zeek 365 371

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (a: :zeek:type:`addr`) : :zeek:type:`NetControl::BlockInfo`

   Get the :zeek:see:`NetControl::BlockInfo` record for an address currently blocked by catch and release.
   If the address is unknown to catch and release, the watch_until time will be set to 0.
   
   In cluster mode, this function works on the manager and workers. On workers, the data will
   lag slightly behind the manager; if you add a block, it will not be instantly available via
   this function.
   

   :param a: The address to get information about.
   

   :returns: The :zeek:see:`NetControl::BlockInfo` record containing information about
            the inserted block.

.. zeek:id:: NetControl::unblock_address_catch_release
   :source-code: policy/frameworks/netcontrol/catch-and-release.zeek 437 460

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (a: :zeek:type:`addr`, reason: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``""`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Removes an address from being watched with catch and release. Returns true if the
   address was found and removed; returns false if it was unknown to catch and release.
   
   If the address is currently blocked, and the block was inserted by catch and release,
   the block is removed.
   

   :param a: The address to be unblocked.
   

   :param reason: A reason for the unblock.
   

   :returns: True if the address was unblocked.
