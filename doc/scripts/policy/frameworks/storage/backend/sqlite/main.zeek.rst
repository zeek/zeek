   :Type: :zeek:type:`record`


   .. zeek:field:: database_path :zeek:type:`string`

      Path to the database file on disk. Setting this to ":memory:" will tell
      SQLite to use an in-memory database. Relative paths will be opened
      relative to the directory where Zeek was started from. Zeek will not
      create intermediate directories if they do not already exist. See
      https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/open.html for more rules on paths that can
      be passed here.


   .. zeek:field:: table_name :zeek:type:`string`

      Name of the table used for storing data. It is possible to use the same
      database file for two separate tables, as long as the this value is
      different between the two.


   .. zeek:field:: busy_timeout :zeek:type:`interval` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``5.0 secs`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`

      The timeout for the connection to the database. This is set
      per-connection. It is equivalent to setting a ``busy_timeout`` pragma
      value, but that value will be ignored in favor of this field.


   .. zeek:field:: pragma_commands :zeek:type:`table` [:zeek:type:`string`] of :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&ordered` :zeek:attr:`&default` = *...* :zeek:attr:`&optional`

      Key/value table for passing pragma commands when opening the database.
      These must be pairs that can be passed to the ``pragma`` command in
      sqlite. The ``integrity_check`` pragma is run automatically and does
      not need to be included here. For pragmas without a second argument,
      set the value to an empty string. Setting the ``busy_timeout`` pragma
      here will be ignored.


   .. zeek:field:: pragma_timeout :zeek:type:`interval` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``500.0 msecs`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`

      The total amount of time that an SQLite backend will spend attempting
      to run an individual pragma command before giving up and returning an
      initialization error. Setting this to zero will result in the backend
      attempting forever until success.


   .. zeek:field:: pragma_wait_on_busy :zeek:type:`interval` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``5.0 msecs`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`

      The amount of time that at SQLite backend will wait between failures
      to run an individual pragma command.


   Options record for the built-in SQLite backend.
