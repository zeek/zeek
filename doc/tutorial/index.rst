.. note::

   Parts of this tutorial are under construction. Some sections may have
   missing parts, or be completely empty.

Welcome to the Zeek tutorial! We will walk you through a basic Zeek setup
and what you need to know in order to deploy Zeek. This will also cover
how to customize Zeek, both via scripting and learning about various
frameworks that you may use. This tutorial is interactive---follow along
on your own machine.

.. note::

   While we hope that you will walk away with a working Zeek
   configuration, we won't discuss third-party content in much
   detail here. This helps the tutorial stay relevant, but may require
   extra consideration when working with extensions to Zeek. The
   :ref:`Popular Customizations <popular-customizations>` section
   details some of them.
