 Zeek Tutorial

.. note::

   Parts of this tutorial are under construction. Some sections may have
   missing parts, or be completely empty.

This is the Zeek tutorial. In it, we will walkthrough a basic Zeek setup
and what you need to know in order to deploy Zeek. This will also cover
how to customize Zeek, both via scripting and learning about various
frameworks that you may use.

.. note::

   While the hope is that you walk away with a working Zeek
   configuration, we will not discuss third-party content in much
   detail. This helps the tutorial stay relevant, but may require extra
   considerations when working with various extensions to Zeek.
