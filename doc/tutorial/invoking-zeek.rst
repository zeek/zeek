 Invoking Zeek
###############

When invoked standalone, Zeek is primarily used from the
command line. You can read a trace file using the `-r` flag, like from
the setup:

.. code:: console

   root@zeek-tutorial:/opt/zeek-tutorial-setup $ zeek -r traces/zeek-doc/quickstart.pcap

You can also use Zeek to analyze live traffic. You have to interrupt the
command to get Zeek to stop with Ctrl+C:

.. code:: console

   root@zeek-tutorial:/opt/zeek-tutorial-setup $ zeek -C -i eth0
   listening on eth0

In another command prompt, connect to the container and use a ping command
to test:

.. code:: console

   $ docker exec -it zeek-tutorial /bin/bash

   root@zeek-tutorial:/ $ ping example.com -c 1
   PING example.com (23.220.75.232) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from a23-220-75-232.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com (23.220.75.232): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=90.0 ms

   --- example.com ping statistics ---
   1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 89.961/89.961/89.961/0.000 ms
   root@zeek-tutorial:/ $ exit 

Back in the original container, use Ctrl+C to exit, then run ``ls`` to
see a few log files. We'll dive deeper into these logs later.

On local environments, it may be useful to tell Zeek to ignore checksums
with the ``-C`` flag. Otherwise, Zeek discards any packets with checksum
errors - due to checksum offloading, this may be all packets in a particular
direction!

*************************
 Providing Script Values
*************************

You may also modify Zeek script values directly from the command line.
We saw this in the quickstart when analyzing the quickstart trace:

.. code:: console

   root@zeek-tutorial:/opt/zeek-tutorial-setup $ zeek -r traces/zeek-doc/quickstart.pcap LogAscii::use_json=T

Or in the setup, when we changed the default logging directory:

.. code:: console

   root@zeek-tutorial:/opt/zeek-tutorial-setup $ zeek -r traces/zeek-doc/quickstart.pcap Log::default_logdir=scratch

But this can be extended further - you can modify any exported script
``option`` or ``&redef`` globals! For example, you can change the FTP
analyzer to capture passwords and log the necessary command:

.. code:: console

   root@zeek-tutorial:/opt/zeek-tutorial-setup $ zeek -Cr traces/zeek-testing/ftp/ftp-password-pass-command.pcap "FTP::default_capture_password=T; FTP::logged_commands+={\"PASS\"};"
   root@zeek-tutorial:/opt/zeek-tutorial-setup $ cat ftp.log
   ...

You can even use ``zeek -e`` and provide arbitrary quoted Zeek script
segments:

.. code:: console

   root@zeek-tutorial:/opt/zeek-tutorial-setup $ zeek -e "print \"hello\"; print\"there\";"
   hello
   there

 Misc
******

Zeek also has a built-in optimization engine called ZAM. This has been
stable since Zeek 7.0. To enable it, just add the ``-O ZAM`` flag to the
Zeek invocation, like so:

.. code:: console

   root@zeek-tutorial:/opt/zeek-tutorial-setup $ zeek -O ZAM -r traces/zeek-doc/quickstart.pcap

This will first compile Zeek’s script into a lower-level form, then
execute that form. For more information, you can read more about it
:doc:`here </script-reference/optimization>`.

TODO: Talk about environment variables, like ZEEKPATH and
ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH maybe

This was just an overview of Zeek’s possible options. Feel free to
browse Zeek’s ``--help`` output for more information:

.. code:: console

   root@zeek-tutorial:/opt/zeek-tutorial-setup $ zeek --help
   zeek version 8.0.3
   ...
