 Scripting Tutorial
####################

We have previously seen Zeek's scripting language, but have not examined
the scripting language in depth. This scripting tutorial will consist of
three parts.

First, a simple walkthrough of language features and how to do various
common tasks. Where needed, there will be links to the :doc:`script
reference </script-reference/index>` to further explain the concepts.

Second, we will build up a small Zeek script from scratch. This should
get many of the necessary parts for any given detection. This is meant
to supplement other references---namely, `try.zeek.org
<https://try.zeek.org>`_ and the :doc:`script reference
</script-reference/index>`. try.zeek.org provides a more interactive
tutorial. The scripting reference goes through each language construct.
This is meant to simply understand the essential components of the
scripting language, then make a custom script.

Third, a basic walkthrough of Javascript as an alternative.

This tutorial should not assume any level of programming. However, it
won't go into fundamentals of many constructs. It is a "learn by doing"
approach. If you do not have much programming experience, you may need
to consult a programming basics tutorial first.
