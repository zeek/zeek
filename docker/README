Container image for Zeek
========================

This directory allows building a minimal container image for Zeek. This image is
published automatically to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/zeek) for
releases and for commits on the `master` branch.

- Images for release are published as
  [`zeek/zeek`](https://hub.docker.com/r/zeek/zeek) with the `latest`
  tag pointing to the latest release.
- Development images for the `master` branch are published as
  [`zeek/zeek-dev`](https://hub.docker.com/r/zeek/zeek-dev).

These images are also pushed to Amazon ECR Public Gallery under
the [Zeek Project](https://gallery.ecr.aws/zeek).

To run the image execute e.g.,:

    docker run -it zeek/zeek

To build the image execute `make` from this directory.

CI
--

Note, the image build process on Cirrus CI is not using the Makefile,
but instead open-codes the invocation due to leveraging Cirrus CI caching
and ccache heavily.
