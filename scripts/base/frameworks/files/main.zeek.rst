   :Type: :zeek:type:`table` [:zeek:type:`Files::Tag`] of :zeek:type:`bool`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`
   :Default: ``{}``

   A table that can be used to disable file analysis completely for
   any files transferred over given network protocol analyzers.

.. zeek:id:: Files::reassembly_buffer_size

   :Type: :zeek:type:`count`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`
   :Default: ``524288``

   The default per-file reassembly buffer size.

   The salt concatenated to unique file handle strings generated by
   :zeek:see:`get_file_handle` before hashing them in to a file id
   (the *id* field of :zeek:see:`fa_file`).
   Provided to help mitigate the possibility of manipulating parts of
   network connections that factor in to the file handle in order to
   generate two handles that would hash to the same file id.

Types
#####
.. zeek:type:: Files::AnalyzerArgs

   :Type: :zeek:type:`record`

      chunk_event: :zeek:type:`event` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`, data: :zeek:type:`string`, off: :zeek:type:`count`) :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         An event which will be generated for all new file contents,
         chunk-wise.  Used when *tag* (in the
         :zeek:see:`Files::add_analyzer` function) is
         :zeek:see:`Files::ANALYZER_DATA_EVENT`.

      stream_event: :zeek:type:`event` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`, data: :zeek:type:`string`) :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         An event which will be generated for all new file contents,
         stream-wise.  Used when *tag* is
         :zeek:see:`Files::ANALYZER_DATA_EVENT`.

         (present if :doc:`/scripts/base/files/extract/main.zeek` is loaded)

         The local filename to which to write an extracted file.
         This field is used in the core by the extraction plugin
         to know where to write the file to.  If not specified, then
         a filename in the format "extract-<source>-<id>" is
         automatically assigned (using the *source* and *id*
         fields of :zeek:see:`fa_file`).

      extract_limit: :zeek:type:`count` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`FileExtract::default_limit` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         (present if :doc:`/scripts/base/files/extract/main.zeek` is loaded)

         The maximum allowed file size in bytes of *extract_filename*.
         Once reached, a :zeek:see:`file_extraction_limit` event is
         raised and the analyzer will be removed unless
         :zeek:see:`FileExtract::set_limit` is called to increase the
         limit.  A value of zero means "no limit".

.. zeek:id:: Files::disable_reassembly

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`) : :zeek:type:`void`

   Disables the file reassembler on this file.  If the file is not 
   transferred out of order this will have no effect.
   

   :f: the file.

.. zeek:id:: Files::enable_reassembly

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`) : :zeek:type:`void`

   Allows the file reassembler to be used if it's necessary because the
   file is transferred out of order.

   Register a callback for file analyzers to use if they need to do some
   manipulation when they are being added to a file before the core code
   takes over.  This is unlikely to be interesting for users and should
   only be called by file analyzer authors but is *not required*.
   

   :tag: Tag for the file analyzer.
   

   :callback: Function to execute when the given file analyzer is being added.

.. zeek:id:: Files::register_for_mime_type

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (tag: :zeek:type:`Files::Tag`, mt: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Registers a MIME type for an analyzer. If a future file with this type is seen,
   the analyzer will be automatically assigned to parsing it. The function *adds*
   to all MIME types already registered, it doesn't replace them.
   

   :tag: The tag of the analyzer.
   

   :mt: The MIME type in the form "foo/bar" (case-insensitive).
   

   :returns: True if the MIME type was successfully registered.

.. zeek:id:: Files::register_for_mime_types

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (tag: :zeek:type:`Files::Tag`, mime_types: :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`string`]) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Registers a set of MIME types for an analyzer. If a future connection on one of
   these types is seen, the analyzer will be automatically assigned to parsing it.
   The function *adds* to all MIME types already registered, it doesn't replace
   them.
   

   :tag: The tag of the analyzer.
   

   :mts: The set of MIME types, each in the form "foo/bar" (case-insensitive).
   

   :returns: True if the MIME types were successfully registered.

.. zeek:id:: Files::register_protocol

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (tag: :zeek:type:`Analyzer::Tag`, reg: :zeek:type:`Files::ProtoRegistration`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Register callbacks for protocols that work with the Files framework.
   The callbacks must uniquely identify a file and each protocol can 
   only have a single callback registered for it.
   

   :tag: Tag for the protocol analyzer having a callback being registered.
   

   :reg: A :zeek:see:`Files::ProtoRegistration` record.
   

   :returns: true if the protocol being registered was not previously registered.

.. zeek:id:: Files::registered_mime_types

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (tag: :zeek:type:`Files::Tag`) : :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`string`]

   Returns a set of all MIME types currently registered for a specific analyzer.
   

   :tag: The tag of the analyzer.
   

   :returns: The set of MIME types.

.. zeek:id:: Files::remove_analyzer

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`, tag: :zeek:type:`Files::Tag`, args: :zeek:type:`Files::AnalyzerArgs` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``[chunk_event=<uninitialized>, stream_event=<uninitialized>, extract_filename=<uninitialized>, extract_limit=104857600]`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Removes an analyzer from the analysis of a given file.
   

   :f: the file.
   

   :tag: the analyzer type.
   

   :args: the analyzer (type and args) to remove.
   

   :returns: true if the analyzer will be removed, or false if analysis
            for the file isn't currently active.

.. zeek:id:: Files::set_reassembly_buffer_size

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`, max: :zeek:type:`count`) : :zeek:type:`void`

   Set the maximum size the reassembly buffer is allowed to grow
   for the given file.
   

   :f: the file.
   

   :max: Maximum allowed size of the reassembly buffer.

.. zeek:id:: Files::set_timeout_interval

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`, t: :zeek:type:`interval`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Sets the *timeout_interval* field of :zeek:see:`fa_file`, which is
   used to determine the length of inactivity that is allowed for a file
   before internal state related to it is cleaned up.  When used within
   a :zeek:see:`file_timeout` handler, the analysis will delay timing out
   again for the period specified by *t*.
   

   :f: the file.
   

   :t: the amount of time the file can remain inactive before discarding.
   

   :returns: true if the timeout interval was set, or false if analysis
            for the file isn't currently active.

.. zeek:id:: Files::stop

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Stops/ignores any further analysis of a given file.
   

   :f: the file.
   

   :returns: true if analysis for the given file will be ignored for the
            rest of its contents, or false if analysis for the file
            isn't currently active.
