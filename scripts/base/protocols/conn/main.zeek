##! This script manages the tracking/logging of general information regarding
##! TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic.  For UDP and ICMP, "connections" are to
##! be interpreted using flow semantics (sequence of packets from a source
##! host/port to a destination host/port).  Further, ICMP "ports" are to
##! be interpreted as the source port meaning the ICMP message type and
##! the destination port being the ICMP message code.
