Support for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) analysis.


Log structure:

DHCPv4 logs transactions


We could also go [txid, iaid] and produce a log for each entry, but that'd
be the correct thing to do!

Probably overthinking if there's only ever a single IAID per transaction,
but in theory this is possible.

# What if there's no IAID? That's okay, too.

So... pivot on IAID?

State:

   transaction_id: count
   ianas: vector of IA_NA

   # Common stuff


# Log entry

txid, ia_na.aid, iaaddr
