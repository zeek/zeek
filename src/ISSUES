TEST SUITE
	broker.remote_id
		failing due to lack of Modified() calls?

	language/delete-field-set.zeek
		what does it mean to delete a field with a &default ?

	language.index-assignment-invalid
		error message has temp variable in it rather than original (ETV)

	language.subnet-errors
		ETV

	language.type-coerce-numerics
		### coercion warning/error

	language.uninitialized-local
	language.uninitialized-local2
		static analysis correctly finds issues prevously missed

	plugins.hooks
		messy - prints lots of embedded function bodies

	scripts.base.frameworks.config.container-options
		fails due to polymorphic any -> set[T] in Config::format_value

	scripts.base.frameworks.control.configuration_update
		failing due to lack of Modified() calls?

	scripts.base.frameworks.file-analysis.bifs.file_exists_lookup_file
		-warning: non-void function returning without a value: Files::lookup_file
		+expression error in <no location>: value used but not set (#0)

	scripts.base.frameworks.input.config.enum-set
		same issue as scripts.base.frameworks.config.container-options

	scripts.base.frameworks.config.read_config_cluster
		failing due to lack of Modified() calls?

	scripts.policy.frameworks.netcontrol.catch-and-release
	scripts.policy.frameworks.netcontrol.catch-and-release-forgotten
		need help understanding these

Test suite should split into error tests vs. functionality tests

the original problem is actually problematic in practice to solve
	due to occurring in benign locations

missing vector elements due to assign-past-end

do we still care about MemoryAllocation()?

vectors don't support ++/--, nor mixed operations w/ scalars

vector of mixed-any
	e.g. language.index-assignment-invalid (expects it to fail)
		vs. language.type-check-vector

assigning vector-of-any (that's actually vector-of-string) to
	local explicitly typed as vector-of-count works in the interpreter
	and *changes the local's type* to vector-of-string

same_object() on atomic types

need to track NewSlot() denizens in case they require memory management

error messages tied back to non-reduced original

really don't want to generate "isn't used" if doing reduction since
	it induces some constant propagation of globals (could turn that
	off though)

recursion, tail-recursion
