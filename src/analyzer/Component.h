     * Constructor.
     *
     * @param name The name of the provided analyzer. This name is used
     * across the system to identify the analyzer, e.g., when calling
     * analyzer::Manager::InstantiateAnalyzer with a name.
     *
     * @param factory A factory function to instantiate instances of the
     * analyzer's class, which must be derived directly or indirectly
     * from zeek::analyzer::Analyzer. This is typically a static \c
     * Instantiate() method inside the class that just allocates and
     * returns a new instance.
     *
     * @param subtype A subtype associated with this component that
     * further distinguishes it. The subtype will be integrated into
     * the Tag that the manager associates with this analyzer,
     * and analyzer instances can accordingly access it via Tag().
     * If not used, leave at zero.
     *
     * @param enabled If false the analyzer starts out as disabled and
     * hence won't be used. It can still be enabled later via the
     * manager, including from script-land.
     *
     * @param partial If true, the analyzer can deal with payload from
     * partial connections, i.e., when Zeek enters the stream mid-way
     * after not seeing the beginning. Note that handling of partial
     * connections has generally not seen much testing yet as virtually
     * no existing analyzer supports it.
     *
     * @param adapter If true, this analyzer is a session adapter from
     * the packet analyzer framework.
