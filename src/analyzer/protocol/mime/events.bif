## Generated for chunks of decoded MIME data from email MIME entities.  MIME
## is a protocol-independent data format for encoding text and files, along with
## corresponding metadata, for transmission. As Bro parses the data of an
## entity, it raises a sequence of these events, each coming as soon as a new
## chunk of data is available. In contrast, there is also
## :bro:id:`mime_entity_data`, which passes all of an entities data at once
## in a single block. While the latter is more convenient to handle,
## ``mime_segment_data`` is more efficient as Bro does not need to buffer
## the data. Thus, if possible, this event should be preferred.
