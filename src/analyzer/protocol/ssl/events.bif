## Generated at the end of an SSL/TLS handshake. SSL/TLS sessions start with

## handshake and its endpoints consider it as fully established. Typically,

## Generated for SSL/TLS alert records. SSL/TLS sessions start with an
## unencrypted handshake, and Bro extracts as much information out of that as
## it can. If during that handshake, an endpoint encounters a fatal error, it
## sends an *alert* record, that in turn triggers this event. After an *alert*,
## any endpoint may close the connection immediately.

## Generated for SSL/TLS handshake messages that are a part of the
## stateless-server session resumption mechanism. SSL/TLS sessions start with
## an unencrypted handshake, and Bro extracts as much information out of that
## as it can. This event is raised when an SSL/TLS server passes a session
## ticket to the client that can later be used for resuming the session. The
## mechanism is described in :rfc:`4507`.

## Generated for X509 certificates seen in SSL/TLS connections. During the
## initial SSL/TLS handshake, certificates are exchanged in the clear. Bro
## raises this event for each certificate seen (including both a site's primary
## cert, and further certs sent as part of the validation chain).

##
## cert: The parsed certificate.
##
## chain_idx: The index in the validation chain that this cert has. Index zero
##            indicates an endpoint's primary cert, while higher indices
##            indicate the place in the validation chain (which has length
##            *chain_len*).
