     * file_analysis::Manager::InstantiateAnalyzer with a name.
     *
     * @param factory A factory function to instantiate instances of the
     * analyzer's class, which must be derived directly or indirectly
     * from file_analysis::Analyzer. This is typically a static \c
     * Instantiate() method inside the class that just allocates and
     * returns a new instance.
     *
     * @param subtype A subtype associated with this component that
     * further distinguishes it. The subtype will be integrated into the
     * Tag that the manager associates with this analyzer, and
     * analyzer instances can accordingly access it via Tag().
     * If not used, leave at zero.
     *
     * @param enabled If false the analyzer starts out as disabled and
     * hence won't be used. It can still be enabled later via the
     * manager, including from script-land.
