globals initialized by expressions should be done with code, not values
	- this would enable globals whose starting values include opaque's

conditional code:
	- top-level conditionals okay due to hash protection
	- but lower-level, directly called, won't translate

	possible approaches:
		- warn when compiling such functions
		- an option to always do Invoke's rather than direct calls
		- rewrite scripts to use run-time conditionals
			(in base scripts, it's almost all regarding clusters)

lambdas: not supported if they refer to events that are otherwise not registered
	(not all that hard to fix)

standalone code won't execute global statements

standalone code needs to deal with field_mapping initializations the
same as enum_mapping

slow compilation:
	- analyze whether there's a bunch of unneeded stuff (e.g. orphan types)

efficiency:
	- leverage ZVal's directly
	- directly calling BiFs
		- best done by supplanting bifcl
	- event handlers directly called, using vector<ZVal> arguments
	- import custom BiFs (e.g. network_time(), cat()) from ZAM
