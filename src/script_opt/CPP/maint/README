This is a collection of scripts to support maintenance of -O gen-C++
(and friends).  They're oriented around running against the BTest test
suite, and are currently tailored for the lead maintainer's own environment.
The scripts all assume you're running them from build/ .

If you make changes to the scripts, format them using

	shfmt -w -i 4 -ci *.sh

The maintenance workflow:

1.  Update this timestamp, so this file will be changed and you'll remember
    to check in updates to the list of how the compiler currently fares
    on various btests (see end of this doc):

	Thu May 12 12:54:10 PDT 2022

2.  Run "find-test-files.sh" to generate a list (to stdout) of all of the
    possible Zeek source files found in the test suite.

3.  For each such Zeek file, run "check-zeek.sh" to see whether Zeek can
    parse it.  This helps remove from further consideration difficult
    tests (like those that have embedded input files, or multiple separate
    scripts).

4.  "mkdir CPP-test" - a directory for holding results relating to C++ testing

5.  Run "check-CPP-gen.sh" for each Zeek file that passed "check-zeek.sh".
    This will generate a corresponding file in CPP-test/out* indicating whether
    "-O gen-C++" can successfully run on the input.  Presently, it should
    be able to do so for all of them.

6.  Copy ./src/zeek to ./zeek.HOLD.  This is used to speed up recompilation used
    in the next step.  However, it's also a headache to do development to
    fix a bug and then forget to update zeek.HOLD, which means you wind up
    running the old version.  You can combat that by removing ./zeek.HOLD
    every time you start working on fixing a bug.

7.  Use the appended database to remove inputs that have known issues.

8.  For every input that survives that pruning, run "do-CPP-btest.sh".
    This will generate C++ for the BTest, compile it, and run the result
    to see if it succeeds.  It populates CPP-test/diag* with the Btest
    diagnostic output (empty means success).  For non-empty output,
    either fix the problem or update the database if it's not fixable.

Database Of Known Issues (be sure to keep sorted)

These BTests won't successfully run due to the indicated issue:

	@if - has conditional code
	bad-when - deliberately has old-style "when" without captures
	command-line-error - a deliberate command-line error
	complex-to-debug - hard-to-figure-out failure
	deprecated - uses features deprecated for -O C++
	no-script - there's no actual script to compile
	ZAM - meant specifically for -O ZAM
