 * This type is used as the key for the map in SessionManager. It represents a
 * raw block of memory that points to a key of some type for a session, such as
 * a ConnKey for a Connection. This allows us to do type-independent
 * comparison of the keys in the map. By default, this type does not maintain
 * the lifetime of the data pointed to by the Key. It only holds a
 * pointer. When a Key object is inserted into the SessionManager's map,
 * the data is copied into the object so the lifetime of the key data is
 * guaranteed over the lifetime of the map entry.
