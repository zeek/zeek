:doc:`/scripts/zeekygen/example.zeek`
    This is an example script that demonstrates Zeekygen-style
    documentation.  It generally will make most sense when viewing
    the script's raw source code and comparing to the HTML-rendered
    version.
    
    Comments in the from ``##!`` are meant to summarize the script's
    purpose.  They are transferred directly into the generated
    `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
    (reST) document associated with the script.
    
    .. tip:: You can embed directives and roles within ``##``-stylized comments.
    
    There's also a custom role to reference any identifier node in
    the Zeek Sphinx domain that's good for "see alsos", e.g.
    
    See also: :zeek:see:`ZeekygenExample::a_var`,
    :zeek:see:`ZeekygenExample::ONE`, :zeek:see:`SSH::Info`
    
    And a custom directive does the equivalent references:
    
    .. zeek:see:: ZeekygenExample::a_var ZeekygenExample::ONE SSH::Info
