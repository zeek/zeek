[environment-AST-dup]
# Environment for testing AST duplication functionality, which is
# needed for script optimization but isn't otherwise exercised.
#
# 5 tests differ, for the following reasons:
#
# language.deprecated
#	Some deprecation messages get reported multiple times, first when
#	constructing the original AST node, and then when duplicating it.
#
# scripts.base.frameworks.input.reread
# plugins.hooks
#	When lambdas are duplicated they get a new UID, which differs
#	from the original.
#
# coverage.zeek-profiler-file
#	Not sure what's going on here, but best guess the problem is
#	that the coverage tracking is looking for execution of the
#	original statements and is not able to associate the duplicated
#	statements with these.  Doesn't seem worth trying to fix.

# it, because some tests look for it when deciding whether to skip or run.
