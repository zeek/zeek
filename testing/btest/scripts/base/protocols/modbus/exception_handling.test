# The pcap has a flow with some fuzzed modbus traffic in it that should cause
# the binpac-generated analyzer code to throw a binpac::ExceptionOutOfBound.
# This should be correctly caught as a type of binpac::Exception and the
# binpac::ModbusTCP::Exception type that's defined as part of the analyzer
# shouldn't interfere with that handling and definitely shouldn't crash bro.
