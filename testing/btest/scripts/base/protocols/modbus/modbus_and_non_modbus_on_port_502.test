# This test causes a baseline difference when run with the Spicy SSL analyzer.
# Specifically, running it with the spicy SSL analyzer causes an
# analyzer-violation to be thrown, which removes the SSL field from conn.log.
#
# This is caused by an interesting edge-case. The trace contains an SSL
# connection, where the client sends a normal client-hello. Instead of replying
# with a server-hello, the server sends an empty handshake-record, followed by
# four bytes of data.
#
# The minimal length of an TLS header is 5 bytes (2 bytes version, 1 byte
# content-type, 2 bytes length). The Spicy analyzer tries to read these four
# bytes, which stop in the middle of an uint16.
#
# As there is a normal connection teardown, this causes an analyzer violation -
# the message is incomplete.
#
# Binpac on the other hand happily ignores the fact that a partial message is
# in flight when the connection ends, and does not raise an error.
#
# In this case, the behavior of Spicy seems saner (there is a problem with the
# connection). However I don't think we can adjust the behavior of binpac to
# fit the Spicy behavior - nor the other way round.

# This traffic should not be labelled as Modbus in conn.log, and not generate any Modbus events.
