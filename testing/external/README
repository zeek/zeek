Test Suite for Large Trace Files
================================

This test-suite runs more complex Zeek configurations on larger trace
files, and compares the results to a pre-established baseline. Due to
their size, both traces and baseline are not part of the main Zeek
repository but kept externally. In addition to the publically provided
files, one can also add a local set to the test-suite for running on
private traces.

Initialization
--------------

Before the test-suite can be run, one needs to download the necessary
files. Test and baselines are kept in git repositories, while any
traces are download directly. A ``Makefile`` is provided to get
everything that's needed initially:

.. console:

    > make init

If you need a proxy to download the traces, enter it into a file
``.proxy`` either in the top-level directory or inside one of the
repositories.

To later update to upstream changes:

.. console:

    > make pull

This updates the tests and the traces as necessary.


Running Tests
-------------

The easiest way to run all tests is simply typing ``make``. Doing so
will iterate through all git repositories found in the current
directory and run the tests in there. Output for failed tests will be
in files ``diag.log`` in the top-level repository directories.

Alternatively, one can also manually run all tests inside a single
test repository:

.. console:

    > cd zeek-testing
    > btest

All the standard ``btest`` options can be used to run individual
tests, get diagnostic output, etc.

Updating Baseline
-----------------

To update a test's baseline, first run ``btest`` in update mode:

.. console:

    > cd zeek-testing
    > btest -u tests/test-you-want-to-update

Then use ``git`` to commit the changes and push the changes upstream
as usual.

Adding a Local Repository
-------------------------

One can add local non-public set of tests (potentially using private
traces) by creating a git repository of a similar structure as the
public one.

If you already have such a private test repository that you want to
include into the test suite, clone it directly into ``<repo-name>``.

If you want to create a new private repository, there's a helper
script to set that up:

.. console:

    > ./scripts/create-new-repo <repo-name> [<repo-url>]

The first argument is the local name of the repository (it will be initialized
in a ``<repo-name>`` directory). The second, optional argument is the URL of the
git repository. The repository will be initialized with a few standard
directories as well as a skeleton test in ``<name>/tests``. You can then edit
files as needed. When provided, the remote URL is added as the origin remote.
The script does not otherwise interact with the remote.

You add trace files by editing ``Traces/traces.cfg``; see the comments in
there. For each trace, you also need to calculate a checksum with ``md5sum`` and
put it into ``<url>.md5sum``. The scripts use this to decide if they need to
redownload the trace. Accordingly, if you update a trace, make sure to also
recalculate its checksum. Note that the traces will be downloaded to ``Traces/``
but must not be added to the git repostiory; there's a ``.gitignore`` installed
to prevent that.
